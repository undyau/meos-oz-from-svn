<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-02-22</p>

<h3>MeOS &ndash; a Much Easier Orienteering System</h3>
MeOS handles those administrative routines need for small and large orienteering events. The goal is ease of use. Small events and trainings need very few settings and almost no preparation.

<br><br>
Larger event are by nature less simple. The goal in this case is rather flexibility; performing the&mdash;sometimes complicated&mdash;tasks needed for a large event should be smooth.

<br><br>
MeOS is built with open source. This means that the program is free to download, install and use, and that anyone who knowledgeable in the art of programming can modify it do suite special needs. Although MeOS is free, it costs money to develop and maintain. If you find MeOS useful and want to support the development, you are welcome to contribute. See MeOS website, <a href="http://www.melin.nu/meos" target="_blank">www.melin.nu/meos</a>. 

<br><br>
The documentation is organized to that the basics are presented first. The first section, <a href="#sec1901" title="The definition of a small event is that only one computer is needed.

<a name="sec1901"></a><h2 class="break">Small Events and Trainings</h2>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-04</p>
The definition of a small event is that only one computer is needed. As a rule of thumb, an event with about 100 competitors works well with one computer. But more important than total number of competitors is number of finishing competitor per minute and how many entry changes and direct entries you need to handle during the event.
<br><br>
There are two fundamentally different ways of using MeOS for small event. The traditional way is to register competitors, classes and courses in advance. This gives the possibility to draw start lists, check which runners remain in forest, etc.
<br><br>
The alternative is to let MeOS build the competition automatically as the comeptitors finish; punching cards are tied to runner's via the competitor database. The courses are constructed from the punches present in the cards read out, and class is decided also from the contents of the card. This mode of operation is particullary suitable for trainings.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>MeOS is equipped with a roubust system for automatically backup the competion. You can read more about this here: <a href="#sec1938" title="All MeOS computers connected to a competition takes an automatic backup of the entire competition everythird minute. The backup is saved in MeOS data folder. The path to this folder varies, but you can see it under ...">Automatic Backup and Restoration</a>.</div><a name="sec1920"></a><h3>Creating a New Competition</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-12</p>
To create a new competition, click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">New Competition</b> on the start page. You may also fetch the competition from <a href="#sec1964" title="MeOS has a direct connection to an Eventor server, which you can use if your country uses Eventor. You need an Eventor API key that you from your club's Eventor administrator. You will enter the key the first time you try to access Eventor.

...">Eventor</a>.
<br><br>
Enter the competition's name, date and first allowed start time. Then you have to choose if you want to import entires now or later. If you choose <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Import Entires</b> you open a new form where you can select import files.

<br><br>In the next step, or if you chose not to import entries, you have to decide which MeOS features you want to make available. You can simplify the user interface by disabling features not used. You may enable any feature at any time by clicking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">MeOS Features</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>.

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Individual competition</b> all functionality needed for an individual competition.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Forked Individual</b> as above, but with support for courses with forks.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Competition with Teams</b> Team competitions, for example relays.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Basic Features</b> include only basic functionality</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">All Features</b> Activate everything and hide nothing</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Details Selection</b> Select exactly what features you need from a detailed list. See <a href="#sec1934" title="When you create a new competition you have to choose which of MeOS feature you want to utilize. By clicking ...">meOS Features</a>.</li></ul><br><a name="sec1902"></a><h3>Preparations</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-14</p>
If you prefer to prepare the competition, to register entries in advance, to setup classes, courses and so on, this section contains basic instructions.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>On the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> there is the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Run Competition Check</b>. Pressing this button opens a report with potential problems in the competition and shows the assigned course of each competitor. Problems detected include competitors without start time, card or course.</div><a name="sec1903"></a><h4>Register Entries</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-24</p>

<h3>On Names</h3>
MeOS has one single field for the competitor's name. Depending on the character of the competition, you may enter a complete name, just the given name or even a nickname. You may enter complete names on the form 
<p class="code">&quot;Given Family [Family 2]&quot; (Alice Smith Norman),</p> or separated by comma <p class="code">&quot;Family [Family 2], Given [Given 2]&quot;, (Smith Norman, Alice Joanna).</p> The latter way is needed in cases where more than one given name is used. Note that the formatting of lists can be affected by very long names; if this becomes a problem you will have to make names shorter by using initials or other adjustments.
<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>In the built-in lists, MeOS shows all names on the form &quot;Given Family&quot; regardless of how you input the names. You can manually format lists in other ways, see <a href="#sec1972" title="You can design your own list if none of the built in lists suits you. You can adapt the layout, font and text size, and the actual contents. You find the list editor on ...">Editing Lists</a>.</div>

When importing entry data from an external source, MeOS will use the comma separated from. If you prefer to always see and work with names on that format, you can set the user preference <tt>NameMode</tt> to <i>1</i>, see <a href="#sec1986" title="When no competition is opened, you may Change Local Settings to alter certain basic settings for MeOS. Settings that you may change include:

...">Local Settings</a>.


<h3>Structured Import</h3>
Importing entry data is the preferable method to register entries. MeOS supports a number of standardized formats, such as OE2003 CSV or IOF-XML (version 3.0 or 2.0.3). Any class or club present is automatically added, and MeOS uses the club database to fill in club details. Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Entries</b> under Import Data on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>.  

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>If your file only includes club numbers, a matching club database must be installed for a correct result.</div>

<h3>Free import</h3>
If you don't have access to entry data in a standardized format, MeOS supports free formatting. Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Free Entry Import</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>. You can now fill in name, club, class, card number and optionally start time, in any order you like. If possible, separate fields with a comma or semicolon. Also, try to add several entries at the same time formatted in the same way. An example of data than can be imported is:

<p class="code">John Plumber, Bushmen OC, Men Short, 800605<br />
George Wood, IF Thor, Men Long, 390101<br />
Steve Clark, Forest Vagabonds, Men Long, 37371<br />
</p>

The formatting is indeed free: another example of importable data is

<p class="code">IF Thor<br />
Johan Svensson, Long, 800605<br />
Sven Johansson, Short, 37371<br />
Johanna Andersson, Long, 390101<br />
</p>
The select  <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Preview</b> and verify the MeOS has interpreted the free text in an appropriate way. Finally, select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Save Entries</b>. If MeOS has difficulties to interpret the data you entered, you can try to reformat the free text. The following suggestions might help:

<ul><li>Use one of the formats described above.</li><li>List at least 5 entries, each row formatted in the same way.</li><li>Add classes manually in advance, this might in particular help if the class names are not standard Swedish or English class names. Also installing a club database with localized club names will help.</li><li>It is possible to use free import to import patrol- and relays classes. In this case, however, it is necessary to add the classes in advance, so that MeOS knows how many team members to expect in each team.</li></ul>

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>If the club database and/or runner database are installed, MeOS will automatically match runners and clubs against it. MeOS will use the database to automatically fill in details about the competitors and clubs.</div>

<h3>Manuel Registration</h3>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i> you can register new competitors. Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">New Competitor</b>, and fill in relevant data. This method is not so practical when there are many people to register. It also assumes that the classes exist, since the page is only available if there are classes.

<h3>Entry Data from Excel and Other Spreadsheet Programs</h3>
If you have entry data in a table in some spreadsheet program, you can use <a href="#sec1965" title="Tables in MeOS works, to some extent, like a spreadsheet table. Here is how you can work with tables in MeOS:

...">Table Mode</a> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i> to paste entries. Also in this case you must create classes in advance.  

<h3>Eventor</h3>
If your country has a central entry system compatible with Eventor, you can use 
MeOS direct link <a href="#sec1964" title="MeOS has a direct connection to an Eventor server, which you can use if your country uses Eventor. You need an Eventor API key that you from your club's Eventor administrator. You will enter the key the first time you try to access Eventor.

...">Eventor Connection</a>, to quickly fetch and configure a competition.

<h3>Quick Entry</h3>
Quick entry is a simplified entry form. First, you must create the classes and make sure to check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Allow quick entry</b>. Access the quick entry form on the page <i style="color:#008;">SportIdent</i>. Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Quick entry mode</b> from the list of functions. If you connect a SI-unit, it is possible to read out a card number, and if the competitions database is updated, runners will be identified automatically.

<br><br>
It is possible to print out start certificates for each new entry. Check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start Certificate</b> and make appropriate <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Printer Settings</b>. You can specify extra lines of text that will print on each start certificate. (You can also print the certificate on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>).

<h3>Runner Database</h3>
You can use <a href="#sec1922" title="The runner database consists of a list with runners and a list with clubs. You typically use some external source for the data. If your country has Eventor, you can get the database automatically, see ...">Runner Database</a> to register entries.

The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Several Courses / Relay</b> is described in detail in the section <a href="#sec1957" title="MeOS support relays of different kinds as well as other special forms of competitions, such as patrol, individuals forks, an integrated prologue + pursuit. Any class with more than one course or leg are collectively referred to as a multi class.

...">Teams, Relays, and Classes with Several Races</a>. For a simple event the most interesting (in the form for several courses) is the possibility to set up a <i>course pool</i>. It means that the course (forking within class) and competitor are tied when the runner finishes. It makes it possible to use forking without deciding in advance who runs what course &ndash; for example a common start and unmarked maps.

<br><br>Another possibility (with several courses) is to setup a simple two stage class, with prologue and pursuit.

<br><a name="sec1905"></a><h4>Defining Courses</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-02-28</p>
Register courses on the page <i style="color:#008;">Courses</i>. A course is defined by a name and a comma separated list of controls (control numbers). Normally, the control number is the same as the punching code, however, it is possible to change to punching code of a control later (for example in case of erroneous control programming), see <a href="#sec1925" title="In most cases, MeOS handles controls automatically for you, but you can make certain manual settings. On ...">Controls</a>.
<br><br>
You can provide the course <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Length</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Climb</b> and the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Number of maps</b>. The latter information is used in the quick entry form to show how many maps are available. But all these fields are optional.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use first control as start</b> means that the first control punch on the course defines the start time. This makes it possible to use an ordinary control as a start unit.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use last control as finish</b> means that the last control punch defines the finish time. A punch in a finish unit is ignored. This option can be used to excuse some classes from a tough finish. 
<br><br>
It is also possible to import courses from a course setting program like OCAD or Condes. MeOS will also try to tie courses and classes automatically (but please verify the result!). If the file you import contains distances between controls, MeOS will store this information and use it to calculate running speed between controls. You can edit these distances manually by clicking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Edit Leg Lengths</b>.
<br><br>
You can also control settings for <a href="#sec1966" title="To use this functionality, you must first activate it.....

MeOS supports Rogaining (collecting points by visiting controls) in two ways:

...">Rogaining</a> on this page.<br><a name="sec1908"></a><h4>Loops With a Common Control</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-05</p>
Assume that you have a course with five loops that a competitor may to run in any order. This gives you 120 possible courses, which is somewhat tedious to setup manually.

<br><br>MeOS solution in this case is a possibility to enter an example of the course, and supply the common control. When a competitor finishes, MeOS wil automatically create a course that matches the actual order of the loops for the runner. MeOS will also sort split times, so that competitors can compare times as if everyone ran the loops in the same order. 

<br><br>Create the course and enter an example of how the (total) course can look like, for example the loops in order ABCDE. You must include the common control between the loops. Check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">course with loops</b> and specify the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">common control</b>.

<br><br>You can also use this functionality for butterfly style forking. 

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>This functionality is primarily intended for trainings, since MeOS cannot check that the loops are taken in any predeclared order. It may be possible to cheat by following someone else.</div>
<br><a name="sec1906"></a><h4>Drawing the Start List</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-07</p>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i> you find the functions <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw / Manage Start Times</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Several Classes</b>. In the list of classes, the symbol <b>[S]</b> indicates that all runners in the class has a start time. If all runners have a common start time, that time shows instead.

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>If you provide start punch units, it is always the actual start time that is used. Do not provide start punch units if you always want to use the drawn start time.</div>

<h3>Drawing Start Times for a Class</h3>
The function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw / Manage Start Times</b> operates only on the selected class. You have to choose a method. 
<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw random</b> means a totally random order.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Swedish method</b> means that times are distributed to ensure that runners from the same club does not start too close. The method uses an algorithm invented long before the computer era, which in the original form involves writing the competitors names on small pieces of paper, shuffling, sorting, and drawing.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Grouped start</b> means that the runners start in small groups of varying size, simulating the situation in the middle of a relay.</li></ul> 
All randomness is based on cosmic background radiation.
<br><br>
The field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start interval</b> is the time between start for normal drawing. If you use groups start, all runners will start during this interval. If you provide a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Number of vacancies</b>, MeOS will add that many vacant positions. The field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Leg</b> is used to draw times of a certain leg in a relay. If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Assign bibs</b> and provide a bib number, MeOS will assign bibs starting with this number.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>Set the start interval to zero, to obtain a simultaneous start.</div>

If the check box <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start pairwise</b> is marked, the runners will start in pairs (combine this option with some forking or a course pool).
<br><br>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Class</b> will assign start times to the entire class. The commands <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Remaining Before</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Remaining After</b> assign start times only to runners without a start time. The competitors are assigned times before or after (respectively) the already assigned times in the class.
<br><br>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Erase Start Times</b> clears all start times in the class.

<h3>Drawing Several Classes</h3>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Several Classes</b> takes you to a form with basic settings. You can fill in <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First start</b> and  <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Least start interval</b>, which is the least start interval within a given class. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Vacancy fraction</b> is given in percent. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Method</b> sets the rule for drawing.
<br><br>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Automatically</b> draw all that remains to be draw without any further interaction from your part. If the courses are setup, MeOS will ensure that runners whose courses have similar opening do not start at the same time. If some runners already have start time, the check box <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Late entries in front</b> decide if remaining runners get start times before or after the already drawn.
<br><br>
You can put the start interval to 00:00 for a multitudinous start. If, in addition, the field for first start is blank, all start times are removed.
<br><br>
See <a href="#sec1944" title="If you are not happy with MeOS automatic draw you can use manual drawing to get full control of all parameters, while you still can use MeOS algorithms to distribute times among classes to get a smooth flow of starts and avoid that runners with similar courses start simultaneously.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-02-22</p>
When many classes share the same course, you sometimes want to draw start times for all classes with a specific course in one block. The start interval for the course becomes even, but within a class the intervals may become irregular.
<br><br>
To achieve this, select a curse on the page <i style="color:#008;">Courses</i> and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Start Times</b>. You can specify First start, Method, and Interval. The number of vacancies refers to the number of vacancies in each class.
<br><br>
You can also achieve this by the option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw classes with the same course together</b> under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Manually</b> when you draw start times for several classes at the same time.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-06</p>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">SportIdent</i> you can read out the SI-card when the runner has finished. Choose the function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Readout/radio</b>.
 
<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>Before using the SI-unit, make sure it is installed and properly programmed; in particular certain device drivers need to be installed if the device connects via USB. On the SportIdent website, <a href="http://www.sportident.com" target="_blank">www.sportident.com</a> you can find device drivers and instructions.</div>

To read out cards the SI-unit must be <b>programed to read out cards</b> and the function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Auto send</b> must be disabled. For radio controls and the finish <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Auto send</b> must be turned on. Auto send is a function in the SI-unit, which is set when you program it. Use SportIdent software SI-Config to program SI-units. 

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>We recommend that you use the <i>extended protocol</i>, which also set by SI-Config. It gives improved stability and much better performance, that is, faster readout, in some situations.</div>

When properly attached, you need to activate the SI-unit in MeOS. Choose the COM port where the SI-unit is installed and click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Activate</b>. You can also ask MeOS to search all COM ports for SI-units, by clicking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Automatic Search and Start</b>. On some computers this can take time or even fail. Reports have also indicated that the unit may disconnect after a while. If you experience such problems we recommend that you restart the unit and activate it directly on the correct COM port. You can attach several SI-units to the same computer.
<br><br>
The option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Interactive readout</b> means that MeOS ask you to fill out any missing data directly at readout. If you haven't registered runners in advance, this is the function that lets you build the competition as runners finish.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>In a large event, you typically handle runners with missing punches, wrong card etc. in a special department. Then you should make sure that <b>interactive readout is not active</b>.</div>

The option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use runner database</b> means that MeOS uses the runner database to match runners and cards. If this option is active and combined with interactive readout, MeOS can lookup an unknown card, find a runner, check if the course in the card matches a class and register the runner in that class without any user interaction. Of course, this logic can go wrong; anyone can run with a borrowed card, for example. If so, you can manually change the name of the runner.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>MeOS can read out cards in the background, while you do something else in the program. In particular it is not necessary that the page SportIdent is active. For example, you can show the result list, which is automatically updated as runners finish.</div>

If you do not use interactive readout, unknown cards are registered as unpaired, see <a href="#sec1924" title="An unpaired card is a card that was read out, but has not yet been tied to a competitor. If you change the card number of a competitor, and there is an unpaired card with that number, it will automatically be tied to that runner.

Handle manual corrections of punches and result on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>. If you want to approve a runner missing punches, you need to add the missing punches manually, see <a href="#sec1912" title="It is possible to edit a card on sidan Competitors. To change a punch, mark it in the list Punches. Modify the time using the field ...">Editing Punches</a>.
<br><br>
When you select a competitor, the readout punches shows together with the expected course. Extra punches, that is, punches that could not be matched against the course, are shown at the bottom. A missing punch is shown as a gap.
<br><br>
The competitors running time is controlled by the fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start time</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Finish time</b>. If you manually want to set the running time, you have to adjust these fields accordingly. The start and finish time are controlled by the start punch and finish punch.

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>If there is a card with a finish punch, it is not possible to directly assign another finish time. Instead, you have to edit the finish punch. The same rule applies to the start punch. The start time can also be determined by the class or by the time for changeover, in case of a relay.</div>

The status shows if the competitor is approved, has a missing punch, is disqualified, etc. The following states are possible: <i><i>Unknown</i> (&ndash;),  <i>Valid Result</i> (OK), <i>Did Not Start</i> (DNS), <i>Missing Punch</i> (MP), <i>Did Not Finish</i> (DNF), <i>Disqualified</i> (DISQ), and <i>Over Maximum Time</i> (OMT)</i>.
In addition, there is a status <i>Not Taking Part</i> (NTP). This means that the runner is filtered away from practically all lists. In a competition with several stages, you can use this status for a runner not taking part in a particular stage.
<br><br>
If there is a card, it controls the status to some extent.
<ul><li>If there is a card, matching the course with a finish punch, it is not possible to set status unknown, DNS, MP or DNF. But it is possible to disqualify the runner.</li><li>If the card does not match the course, it is not possible to set status OK; you have to add the missing punches to the card. The status is DNF if there is no finish punch.</li><li>If there is a finishing time, it is not possible to set the status DNF.</li></ul>

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-02-28</p>
The check box <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Print splits automatically</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">SportIdent</i> means that MeOS will print a page with split times as soon as you read out a card. You can print to any printer, including a special receipt printer. MeOS will adapt the format of the print to the shape of the paper. Use the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Print Splits</b> to configure the printing and to choose and setup the printer.

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Printer</b> lets you choose and setup the printer.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">With split analysis</b> means that MeOS makes a preliminary analysis of lost time, which is presented as time lost per control. This analysis will be more accurate when several competitors has finished.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Include tempo</b> shows the competitors tempo (min/km) if the course length is available. If individual leg lengths are available (when courses are imported from a course setting software, they typically are), MeOS also<br />
prints the tempo for individual legs.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Custom text lines</b> lets you define custom lines that are printed<br />

You can also print split times manually. Find the competitor on  the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>, and click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Print Splits</b>.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>If you use a receipt printer, take care to setup the correct paper format, for example 72mm x Receipt. Sometimes you have to look deep into advanced printer settings to find this setting; this varies with printer model and operating system. If you happens to print with A4 setting, the typical symptom is miniature text, like a shrunk A4.</div>

If you prefer to print split times on A4 or a similar standard format, optionally with several runners on each page to save paper, mark <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Times in columns (for standard paper)</b>. You can also specify to collect several cards on the same sheet (<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Maximum number of cards per page</b>) and give the maximal waiting time (<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Longest time in seconds to wait for the printout</b>). If this time is reached, the print is made even though the number of read out cards waiting for a printout has not yet reached the specified number.<br><a name="sec1914"></a><h4>Start and Result Lists</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-21</p>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> you will find (among other things) start and result lists. All lists have the functions <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Print</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">PDF</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Web Document</b>, which prints the list or saves it as a PDF or HTML file for the web. In the latter case, you will choose between a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Structured</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Formatted</b> web document. Structured means that the list is constructed in an invisible table. The advantage is that the table structure will enable you to copy the list into a word processor and that the web browser can adapt column with for each user. Formatted means that MeOS places all text by specifying the position for each letter. Then the page will match the original more closely.

<br><br>Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">New Window</b> to open the list in its own window.

This function can be an alternative to printed lists.

<br><br><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Remember the List</b> saves current list settings, for example the class selection. You can then quickly access the list again from the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i>. The saved list is stored with the competition, and accessible for anyone opening the competition.

<br><br><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Copy</b> copies the entire list to the clipboard. You can paste it into a word processor or spreadsheet program.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-06</p>
Handle Remaining Runners the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>. Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Remaining Runners</b> to see a list with <i>Runners Without Registration</i>. These runners (or rather their SI-card) has not been encountered at all during the competition. The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Set Status  for Runners without Registration</b> changes the status for these runners to <b>Did Not Start</b>.
<br><br>
If all runners has checked their cards or used a start punch, you can readout these units (you can also readout controls and clear units). Then all runners who have punched anywhere will disappear from this list, and are instead moved to the list <i>Runners, Status Unknown, with Registration</i>. These runners remain, with some certainty, in forest..
<br><br>
To read out the punches from a SI unit, use the program <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">SI-Config</b>, provided by SportIdent. Choose to save the readout as a semicolon separted file (csv) and import this file to MeOS by the command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Import Punches</b>.
<br><br>
If you accidentally clicked the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Set Status  for Runners without Registration</b> when not all check units (or similar) was read out, too many runners will get status DNS. When you have read out the remaining check units, these runners will show up in the list <i>Runners, Status DNS, with Registration</i>. The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Reset Status  to  for Runners with Registration</b> will reset the status for these runners.
<br><br>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> there is a list called Remaining Runners. It shows all runners that have not yet finished, sorted by class and start time. It is just a convenient view of the same information.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-21</p>
In addition to normal result list, MeOS can provide an individual result report optimized for viewing on screen. Go to the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i> and click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Report Mode</b>.
<br><br>
Select the runner from a drop down list. If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Show last read out competitor</b>, MeOS will automatically switch to the runner who reads out his/her card on that computer. You can show this view while reading out cards for a direct report.
<br><br>
When you have selected a competitor you will see a graphical view with all controls, splits, statistics and estimated lost time.
<br><br>
The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result Kiosk</b> puts MeOS in a mode where only the result report is reachable. You cannot make any changes to the competition and you cannot exit this mode without restarting MeOS. If you have connected a SI unit, it is used only to select the runner being displayed. If you give competitors access to a result kiosk, you should consider protecting the competition database with a password.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>If a competitor is part of a team, you will see the entire team. Also reported radio times are included, so this view can be used to let runners follow the team's progress prior to the changeover. For example, you may supply on-line check units at the entrance to the changeover area.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-14</p>
An <i>unpaired card</i> is a card that was read out, but has not yet been tied to a competitor. If you change the card number of a competitor, and there is an unpaired card with that number, it will automatically be tied to that runner. 
<br><br>
The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Handle Cards</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i> brings you to a table with all read out cards.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-03-23</p>
If you with to interactively pair competitors and cards, for example when checking in to the changeover in relay, you use the function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Assign rented cards</b>on the page <i style="color:#008;">SportIdent</i>. Check the option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Interactive readout</b>.

Type (or use a bar code reader) to fill in the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">bib, race id, name</b>. 
<ul><li>If you enter the initial letters of a name and wait a moment, MeOS will make a search. The result is shown under the field. The MeOS found the right match, you do not have to type any more, otherwise you enter more letters.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Race Id is a unique identifier that is assigned to each race. You can access all race id number in the table on page competitors, which can be used to print a corresponding bar code on bibs. It is also possible to define custom race id number and paste into the table. The race id is kept when filling in vacancies or changing team members.</li></ul>

Read out the card or type in the card number. If <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Auto assign on readout</b> is checked the card and competitors is paired immediately. Otherwise you need to confirm using <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">OK</b>.

Check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Borrowed</b> if the assigned card should be marked as a borrowed card.<br><a name="sec1925"></a><h3>Controls</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-03-11</p>
In most cases, MeOS handles controls automatically for you, but you can make certain manual settings. On the page <i style="color:#008;">Controls</i> you can see all used controls. Every control has a unique id number. Normally, this number is the same as the punching code, but the punching code can be changed if needed. 

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>Refer to the <b>id number</b> when defining a course.</div>

You may assign a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Name</b> to each or some controls. This name is used in the Speaker Module, and you can also print result lists with splits at named controls. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Status</b> defines how a control is used. Possible values are
<i>OK</i>, <i>Multiple</i>, <i>Rogaining</i>, or <i>Bad</i>.

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">OK</b> means that the control is operating normally; a competitor  has passed the control if one of the specified punch codes has been registered. Several punch codes can be specified to accomplish simple forking or to replace a non-functional control.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Multiple</b> means that the competitor need to register all specified punch codes to pass the control. This functionality can be used to create a nest of controls that can be taken in any order.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Bad</b> means that the control is not used at all; the result is that same is if the control was removed from all courses.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rogaining</b> is described in the section <a href="#sec1966" title="To use this functionality, you must first activate it.....

MeOS supports Rogaining (collecting points by visiting controls) in two ways:

...">Rogaining</a>.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">No timing</b> means that MeOS ignores the time on the leg to the control (from the previous control) when times are calculated. The effect is that the punching time on the control is the same as the punching time on the previous control, and that the total running time is independent of the actual time on the leg to this control.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Optional</b> means that punching the control is not obligatory to get a final result, but the time will be included in the split time analysis if the control was punched.</li></ul>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time adjustment</b> is used when the time in the control is wrong; write a time adjustment using the format +/- MM:SS. 
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Minimum leg time</b> means that no runner can get a time on the leg that is faster than the specified time. If the runner is faster, the all following times are adjusted. This can be use to cross a road with traffic without time pressure. Note that the time adjustment cannot be done until after the runner has finished, so radio times can be somewhat wrong when this functionality is in use.

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>Note that any change you make will have global effect immediately. All results are recalculated and all lists are updated.</div>
<a name="sec1926"></a><h4>Table Mode and Statistics</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-10-31</p>
During and after the competition, you will find some usage statistics for each control. How many visitors it has and how much time competitors has spent searching for it (lost time).

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-18</p>
Shortenings are used to let some competitors run a shorter course variant within a class. A common use is to let runners in a restart take a shorter course.

Those running the shorter course will automatically be placed behind everyone taking the longer variant. MeOS automatically determine which course variant was run when reading out the punching card.

<h3>Using Shortened Courses</h3>
<ul><li>Add the standard (long) course and the shortened variant as normal courses on the page <i style="color:#008;">Courses</i>.</li><li>Select the standard course and check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">With shortening</b>.</li><li>Select the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Shortened course</b>.</li></ul>

It is possible to create several layers of shortened variants by defining a shortening to the already shortened course.<br><a name="sec1929"></a><h3>More About Lists</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-22</p>
Any list in MeOS is updated directly, as soon as competition data is changed. To create an automatic printout or export for the web, you can always click the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Automatize</b>, see <a href="#sec1927" title="Automatic result printing and export for the web is done by the service Print / Export Results on sidan Services...">Automatic Printing and File Export</a>.

<h3>Advanced Result Lists</h3>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i>, under <b>Results</b>, you find the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Advanced</b>, which gives you access to specialized lists. You also have the possibility select precisely which classes to generate results for. Here follows a short description of some possibilities not already covered by section <a href="#sec1914" title="On sidan Lists you will find (among other things) start and result lists. All lists have the functions ...">Start and Result Lists</a>. Note that some lists doesn't support all options.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">List with split times</b> means that split times are included for named controls, see section <a href="#sec1925" title="In most cases, MeOS handles controls automatically for you, but you can make certain manual settings. On ...">Controls</a>. 
<br><br>
The options <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">from control</b> &ndash; <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">to control</b> generates a result list for a part of the course.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>You can make a list from the start to a radio control, to create a result list for the radio. Times are calculated as in the speaker system. The list <i>general results</i> will often give you a suitable formatting.</div>

The field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">leg</b> is used to access a certain leg in a rely. Many list also supports a custom <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">list heading</b>.

<h3>All Lists</h3>
The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">All lists</b> gives you access to all lists defined in MeOS. Here follows an incomplete list of the lists:

<ul><li>Report with rented cards</li><li>First to finish (class-wise)</li><li>First to finish (common list for all classes).</li><li>Prize ceremony list, that includes information on which places are settled, or at what time a certain place will be settled in each class.</li><li>Minute start list</li><li>Course assignment, who runs which course.</li><li>Rogaining, see <a href="#sec1966" title="To use this functionality, you must first activate it.....

MeOS supports Rogaining (collecting points by visiting controls) in two ways:

...">Rogaining</a></li><li>Results sorted course-wise.</li><li>Results course-wise and class-wise. Each forking in a class has its own result list.</li></ul>
<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>MeOS shows direct buttons to the most common lists for your competition.</div>

<h3>Stored Lists</h3>
The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Remember the List</b> that is shown with every list, saves the current setting in a collection of stored lists on the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i>. You can <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Show</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rename</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Remove</b> saved lists. You can also <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Merge</b> two lists meaning that they will be showed on the same page. If you select such a merged list, there is also the option to <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Split</b> it into its components.

<h3>Custom Lists</h3>
The <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Edit List</b> start the List editor, described in <a href="#sec1972" title="You can design your own list if none of the built in lists suits you. You can adapt the layout, font and text size, and the actual contents. You find the list editor on ...">Editing Lists</a>. The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manage Custom Lists</b> opens a view where see custom lists added to the competition and custom lists that you can add, and lets you browse for lists defined in an external file.<br><a name="sec1927"></a><h3>Automatic Printing and File Export</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-16</p>
Automatic result printing and export for the web is done by the service <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Print / Export Results</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Services</i>.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>A convenient way to setup a printing job for a certain list is to use the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Automatize</b> found to the right of the list.</div>

For a printing / export service, you can select if the list should be <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Printed</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Exported</b>. In the first case, you need to choose a printer and printer settings. In the latter case, you need to select a file to export to. If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Structured export format</b>, the HTML is exported as a table, which is suitable for import in other programs, such as a Word Processor, for further editing. Otherwise the export is made in a free format. You can also enable <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">HTML with AutoRefresh</b>, which means the that web browser is instructed to reload the page with the same interval is the export interval.
<br><br>
You can tell MeOS to run a script after each export. This functionality is useful for <a href="#sec1928" title="The service that exports lists in html format can run a custom script after each export. This can be use to publish live results on the Internet. (See also ...">Exporting Lists to the Internet</a>.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time interval</b> defines how often the list is printed / exported.

<br><br>
If you started the service manually, you find some options to define the list to be printed / exported, see the section on <a href="#sec1914" title="On sidan Lists you will find (among other things) start and result lists. All lists have the functions ...">lists</a> for more information. In addition, there is the option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">only print modified pages</b> which means that only pages not printed before will be printed.

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>If you choose to only print changed pages, it can happen that only page two in a certain class is printed. The person putting up results has to be aware of this.</div> 

If you restart the service, MeOS will forget what pages it has printed before, and reprint everything.<a name="sec1928"></a><h4>Exporting Lists to the Internet</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-07</p>
The service that <a href="#sec1927" title="Automatic result printing and export for the web is done by the service Print / Export Results on sidan Services...">exports lists</a> in html format can run a custom script after each export. This can be use to publish live results on the Internet. (See also <a href="#sec1932" title="On sidan Services you find Results On-Line. This service exports competition data in various formats, either as a file or as a direct upload to a web server. To publish results on orientering.se/liveresultat, see ...">Publishing Live Results on the Internet</a>) Here is an example of how this can be accomplished using FTP:
<ul><li>Create an empty folder, for example <i>c:\temp\meosexport</i>.</li><li>Copy the script below to <i>send.bat</i>, and put it in the folder.</li></ul>

<p class="code"><b>send.bat</b><br />
REM Send files to FTP server<br />
<br />
date /T &gt;&gt; log.txt<br />
time /T &gt;&gt; log.txt<br />
ftp.exe -v -i -s:command.txt &gt;&gt; log.txt</p>

<ul><li>The script runs commands from the file <i>command.txt</i>, which you must also create in the same folder. In addition, the transfers are logged in <i>log.txt</i>.</li></ul>

<p class="code"><b>command.txt</b><br />
open ftp.myserver.net<br />
myusername<br />
mypassword<br />
LITERAL PASV<br />
cd upload/results<br />
mput c:\temp\meosexport\*.htm*<br />
close<br />
bye</p>

<ul><li>You have to change the commands so that <i>ftp.myserver.net</i> points to your FTP server, <i>myusername</i> is your user name and <i>mypassword</i> is the password. The script will upload all files with extension <i>.htm</i> or <i>.html</i> to the folder <i>upload/results</i> on the server, so you have to change that folder to the correct target directory on your server.</li><li>You can test the script by double clicking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">send.bat</b>. Put a custom html file in c:\temp\meosexport and check that it was uploaded to the server as intended.</li><li>Configure the service to export results to <i>c:\temp\meosexport\resultat.html</i> and to run the script <i>c:\temp\meosexport\send.bat</i>.</li></ul>

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br><ul><li>Remember to link to the uploaded files from your website in advance.</li><li>If you intend to export server files, it is enough to start the script from one of the services, provided all services write their files to the same folder.</li><li>You can of course publish the start list live as well, if there are many late changes...</li></ul></div>

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-02-23</p>
MeOS can operate competitions running over several days. To support competition times over 24 hours, you need to activate support for long competition times on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>. You should do this if you expect any competitor to have a running time of 20 hours or more.

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>Use only SICard 6 or later for competitions with long times. If and only if the last finish is within 12 hours from the zero time, it is possible to use older cards.</div>

When you activate support for long times, you will no longer need to specify the zero time (it is always 00:00:00), but rather the date when all competitors or teams will start; everyone is expected to start this day. The exception is for teams with several legs. It is allowed for runners on leg two and later to start more than 24 hours after the zero time when if that is when the change over happens.
<br><br>
To clarify, for competitions with long running times, the zero time is always 00:00:00, midnight in the beginning of the competitions first day. 
<br><br>

To manually specify a time later than the first day, use the syntax <i>2D 14:00:00</i>, which is interpreted as <i>14:00</i> two days after the zero time (that is 62 hours after the zero time). You may omit  <i>0D</i> for times during the first day, that is, you may write <i>14:00:00</i> instead of <i>0D 14:00:00</i>.

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br><ul><li>There is no practical limit for the total competition time. But the time between two consecutive punches may not be longer than 22 hours. You should set the courses so that no competitor run the risk of exceeding this limit. If that happens anyway, MeOS cannot guarantee that the total time becomes correct; it can be one or several days too short, and you have to adjust the times manually.</li><li>Since the punches from the system does not contain the date of each punch, MeOS will make certain guesses on which date a particular punch happened. (hence the 22 hour rule mentioned above). For times coming from radio controls, MeOS will instead use the receiving computer's local time setting to determine the date. If there are large delays in the communication, or punches are read in afterwards, MeOS cannot guarantee that the times become correct.</li></ul></div>

<br><a name="sec1986"></a><h3>Local Settings</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-02-23</p>
When no competition is opened, you may <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Change Local Settings</b> to alter certain basic settings for MeOS. Settings that you may change include:

<ul><li><tt>AutoSaveTimeOut</tt>, which controls how often MeOS will make an automatic backup (in milliseconds)</li><li><tt>DirectPort</tt>, which specifies the network port MeOS will use for direct communication between clients.</li><li><tt>SynchronizationTimeOut</tt>, which specifies how often MeOS will pull the database for changes, for example when showing lists.</li><li><tt>UseHourFormat</tt> specifies if times are formatted as HH:MM:SS or MMM:SS.</li><li><tt>TextFont</tt> specifies with type face MeOS uses.</li><li><tt>MaximumSpeakerDelay</tt> Is the largest acceptable delay allowed in the speaker module (milliseconds). Usually, update are must faster (see <tt>SynchronizationTimeOut</tt>), but if the network or the speaker computer starts to run very slowly, the update speed is adjusted so that the client or network will not be blocked. This parameter controls the upper limit for the adjustments.</li></ul>
<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>For certain settings to have effect, MeOS will need a restart. All settings are stored in <tt>meospref.xml</tt> in MeOS data folder. If you want to reset all values you may delete this file when MeOS is not running.</div>

MeOS is not limited to small events and traings, but is suitable also for large events with thousands of competitors. This section includes additional documentation on features needed for large events. Before reading, you should be familiar with the basics of MeOS.<br />
<a name="sec1937"></a><h3>Using MeOS in a Network</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-15</p>
To use MeOS in a network with more than one computer connected to the same competition, you need a computer acting as server. Install MySQL server on this computer. Use MySQL version 5.0 or later. 
<div class="info">MySQL, Community Edition, is free and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">www.mysql.com</a>. You can install with default options, see <a href="#sec1940" title="Installing MySQL is not much more difficult than installing any other program. You download and run an installer. You can use the default options in most cases. (An exception is the security settings, see below)


...">Installing MySQL</a></div>

On the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i> select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Database Connection</b>. Now you can enter server specific data, and you also get information on how to configure the server.
<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>Firewalls can cause various problems. The most common symptom is that it is not possible to connect at all. Even worse, <i>smart</i> firewall can decide to analyze all incoming traffic, with the effect that the network works, but is extremely slow. Our recommendation is disable firewalls entirely during the competition, at least on the server.
<br><br>
A wise action is then to <i>not</i> let Internet be generally available over the network. Make sure that only those computers that really need an Internet connection has connection (and possibly also an active firewall).</div>

In the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">MySQL server</b>, type the name of the server or its IP address. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Username</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">password</b> refers to user name and password for MySQL, not the login of the computer. The field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">port</b> can normally be left blank. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Client name</b> is the name of your computer. You will see this name in a list of connected computers. You can choose names such as <i>Read out 1</i>, <i>Direct Entry 3</i>, and so on, if you like.
<br><br>
After you connected, you will see some information on the server you connected to. If no competition is open, you will see two lists, one with local competitions and one with competitions on the server. 
<br><br>
Select a competition from one of the lists, and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Open Competition</b>.

<br><br>
To upload a competition to the server, open it locally in MeOS. Verify that you are connected to the right server (or connect to the right server) and click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Upload Competition to Server</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Database Connection</i>. Now, other clients can connect to the server, and open the competition you uploaded.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>Verify that the <a href="#sec1922" title="The runner database consists of a list with runners and a list with clubs. You typically use some external source for the data. If your country has Eventor, you can get the database automatically, see ...">Runner Database</a> is up-to-date on the computer that you upload the competition from. All connected clients will use that database.</div>

When you open a competition on the server, the headline of MeOS will change to indicate that you run against a server.

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>Make sure all computers are connected to the server.</div>

<h3>Fast Advance Information</h3>
If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Send and receive	fast advance information on control punches and results</b> MeOS will broadcast information to the entire local network as soon as a result it changed. Other MeOS clients that listen to this information are able to update result lists and speaker lists immediately, without accessing the server, which gives a few seconds delay. Only one MeOS session on each computer can listen to this information. Even if MeOS fails to listen to this information, all data will be up-to-date, as soon MeOS communicates via the database some seconds later. 

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>MeOS communicates the Fast Advance Information via UDP broadcast on the local network. All MeOS clients started on one single computer may broadcast, but only the first started client can listen to that port; you will get an error when you connect the second client, as discussed above. 

<br><br>By default MeOS uses port 21338, but this can be controlled by changing <tt>DirectPort</tt>, see <a href="#sec1986" title="When no competition is opened, you may Change Local Settings to alter certain basic settings for MeOS. Settings that you may change include:

...">Local Settings</a>. You need to allow this traffic through any firewall. If you change the value, make sure to set the same port on all client computers.

<br><br>Note that different competitions may coexist in the same network, and use the same port without interference. This will work as long as the id (in the database) of the competitions are distinct, which is guaranteed if the same MySQL server is used for all competitions. </div>

<h3>Disconnecting from the Database</h3>
If you select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Disconnect Database</b> when a server competition is open, you get a local copy of the competition named &quot;<i>name (local copy from: server name)</i>&quot;. You should only use this copy in an emergency situation, since it is not guaranteed to be complete (it is in fact a snapshot of what is on your computer at the moment you disconnected).
<br><br>
To create a backup, use instead <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Backup / Save As</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>. 
<a name="sec1940"></a><h4>Installing MySQL</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-22</p>
Installing MySQL is not much more difficult than installing any other program. You download and run an installer. You can use the default options in most cases. (An exception is the security settings, see below)


<ul><li>Download the latest version of <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> Community Server from Oracle. Here is a direct link (2014-03-22) <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" target="_blank">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> to the download page. When you have selected a version you are encouraged to create an Oracle account, but that is not necessary, at the bottom of the page, there is a link that enables download without an account.</li><li>Run the installer. Accept the license agreement and choose <i>Typical</i> installation. MySQL is now installed. After clicking through some information pages, you get an option to configure MySQL now (Launch the MySQL Instance Configuration Wizard). Do that.</li><li>Configuring MySQL. You can use <i>Standard Configuration</i>. Then choose <i>Install as Windows Service</i> and <i>Launch Automatically</i>.</li><li>If you prefer a details installation we recommend <i>Developer Machine</i> (unless you plan for more than 20000 competitors) and <i>Non-Transactional Database Only</i>. You can specify how many MeOS-clients you wish to connect (Number of Concurrent Connections). Activate TCP/IP and choose a port (the default is warmly recommended).</li><li>Now you see the page <i>Security options</i>. Choose <i>Modify Security Settings</i> and type a password for the root account. If you only are using MySQL for MeOS you can use the root account and skip creating a special account for MeOS. Then check <b>Enable root access from remote machines</b>. In MeOS you specify the user name <b>root</b> and your password.</li><li>Turn off or configure internal network firewalls.</li><li>Try to connect MeOS to the server. Try first the server computer. You can then specify <i>localhost</i> in the field MySQL server. On other computers you need to specify the server name on the network or its IP address (IPv4), which you can find out by clicking <i>Show status</i> for the connection in Windows network and sharing center.</li></ul>
<br><a name="sec1939"></a><h4>Server and Network Problems</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-01</p>
If MeOS access to the server is broken you will get a notification. MeOS will allow you to continue to work with the competition or to readout cards, and will try to continue restoring the database connection in the background. 
<br><br>
When the database connection is restored, all changes you made since it was lost are automatically transferred to the server, and will be available to other MeOS users. <i>In conclusion: it is possible to handle a brief power failure or restart of the server without interrupting the work of attached computers.</i>

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>The automatic recovery should be used with some caution, and only if you believe the server will be restored. If you are unable to restore the server, changes will be lost.</div>

The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Disconnect Server</b> on the page with server settings, makes MeOS stop trying to reconnect, and continue to work locally. You can use the log files created when reading out cards, to manually transfer data to a main computer, in case of a permanent network failure, see <a href="#sec1938" title="All MeOS computers connected to a competition takes an automatic backup of the entire competition everythird minute. The backup is saved in MeOS data folder. The path to this folder varies, but you can see it under ...">Automatic Backup and Restoration</a>.
<br><br>
If you get database errors when trying to open a competition, you can try to repair the database. Make sure that no one else is working with the database. We recommend disconnecting the network cables or making the network router or switch powerless to be certain. Then click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Repair Selected Competition</b> on the database page in MeOS (the one MeOS instance that is still connected to the server). If this command succeeds, you should be able to open the competition again, and restore the other clients.
<br><br>
If repairing does not work or help, you need to restore the last backup (see <a href="#sec1938" title="All MeOS computers connected to a competition takes an automatic backup of the entire competition everythird minute. The backup is saved in MeOS data folder. The path to this folder varies, but you can see it under ...">Automatic Backup and Restoration</a>) and upload it to the server as a new competition.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-03</p>

Section <a href="#sec1904" title="Go to sidan classes. For a simple event, Show advanced settings need not be checked; you then get a simplified view with out (cluttering) settings only needed for larger events. 
...">Adding Classes</a> gives an overview of classes in MeOS. More settings are available if you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">show advanced settings</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>.

<ul><li>In the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">type</b>, you can define different types of classes, for example elite, youth, open, or any arbitrary tag. You can use the class type to manually assign different fees to competitors in different classes.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start name</b> is a name of the start, for example <i>Start 1</i> and <i>Start 2</i>, but any name, for example the name of a sponsor, can be used. The name of the start is printed in the start list.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start blocks</b> are used to generate minute start lists. If Start 1 has two entrances, the classes that use the first entrance should use start block 1 and the classes that use the second entrance should be assigned start block 2. You get one minute start list for each block.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Status</b> can be changed if you need to cancel an entire class. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Fee refunded</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">No refund</b> determines if the entry fee is included in the invoices. If you select fee refunded, there will be no fee for the class on the invoice.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Free start time</b> only means that MeOS will not automatically draw start times for the class. The runner's start punch, if present, will be used irregardless of this setting. Only provide start punch units when you want to use start punches.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Ignore start punch</b> means that MeOS unconditionally ignores the start punch.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result on finish punch</b> means that no card readout is necessary. MeOS will calculate the final result when the runner punches (the attached) finish control. If there is no coarse, the runner will automatically be given status OK. If there is a course, registered radio punches will be used as controls. If any punch is missing, the status is MP. If you read out the card, the registered punches will be replaced with actual card data.</li></ul>

<h3>Quick Settings</h3> 
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">quick settings</b> brings you to a table like form where certain settings can be changed for all classes at once. You can change the sort order for classes by chancing the number in the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">index</b>; MeOS sorts classes increasingly on this number.

<br><br>If you have <a href="#sec1934" title="When you create a new competition you have to choose which of MeOS feature you want to utilize.

By clicking ...">activated</a> MeOS support for <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">bibs</b>, you can make bib settings for each class here. The options are:

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manual</b>, meaning that MeOS will not assign bibs to the class automatically. You can assign bibs manually, for example when drawing start times.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Consecutive</b>, meaning that the first bib in the class follows the last bib of the previous class, optionally with a gap: the setting <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Number of reserved bib numbers between classes</b>.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">None</b>, meaning that MeOS will remove bibs from the class.</li><li>You can also type in a number (or a combination letter-number, such as A100 or 100-E), which will be used as first number in the class.</li></ul>

If the class has teams, there is one more column where you can specify the team members' bibs in relation to the team's bib. You can specify <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Same</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Leg</b> (100-1, 100-2, 100-3 etc), <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Increasing</b> (100, 101, 102), or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Independent</b>, which means that can you assign team member bibs independently.


<h3>Functions</h3>
Use the command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Bib</b> to assign bibs to a class (this can also be done in connection with the drawing of start lists). Enter the first number used in the class. You can also remove bibs. 

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>If you use direct entry in a class with bibs, new entries will automatically be assigned a bib &ndash; the current highest number in the class plus one.</div>

To merge two classes into one, select one of the classes and click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Merge Classes</b>.

If ranking data or result from the earlier stage is missing, you will get an error message if you try to use a corresponding method.
<br><br>
When you have set the number of classes, you can also specify, for each class, how many competitors or teams you want to put into the class. Note that the specified value is an objective: if club affiliation, ranking, or result does not distinguish competitors, they are always held together, even when it means that a class become too large.

<br><br><a name="sec1944"></a><h3>Advanced Start List Drawing</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-15</p>
If you are not happy with MeOS <a href="#sec1906" title="On sidan Classes you find the functions Draw / Manage Start Times and Draw Several Classes. In the list of classes, the symbol ...">automatic draw</a> you can use manual drawing to get full control of all parameters, while you still can use MeOS algorithms to distribute times among classes to get a smooth flow of starts and avoid that runners with similar courses start simultaneously.
<br><br>
Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Several Classes</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i> and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw Manually</b>. You need first enter a few parameters for the distribution.
<br><br>
The setting <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Max number parallel start</b> defines how many runners are allowed to start at the same time, at most. We recommend that you treat one 
(physical) start at the time, and this limit applies to the classes selected for this draw operation.
<br><br>
If you have added the courses, MeOS will use this to ensure that competitors in different classes with similar courses do not start at the same time.
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Max number common controls</b> defines how many controls two competitors starting at the same moment are allowed to share from the beginning. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">None</b> means that every one starting at the same time have distinct first controls. If there are only few possible first controls, the start depth will probably be too long and then you should try to allow the first, or more, controls to be common.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Allow same course within start interval</b> means that if two classes have the same course, one of them can start on even minutes, and the other class can start at odd minutes. Otherwise this is not allowed.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw classes with the same course together</b> means that classes with the same course are drawn as one single class. The start interval for runners on the course is constant, while it varies within the classes. See <a href="#sec1988" title="When many classes share the same course, you sometimes want to draw start times for all classes with a specific course in one block. The start interval for the course becomes even, but within a class the intervals may become irregular.
...">draw Classes with a Specific Course Together</a>.
<br><br>

<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Base interval</b> is the interval between each possible start moment, usually one minute. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Smallest interval in class</b>, is the smallest allowed interval for a class, and is a multiple of the base interval. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Greatest interval in class</b> is the upper limit. (For a given class, the start interval is always constant.) To ensure that all classes have the same start depth, enter the same number in these two fields.

<br><br><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Vacancy fraction</b> defines how many vacant positions that are to be added to the class. You specify a percentage of the number of entries, and also an upper and lower limit. In the next step you will be able to manually adjust the number for each class.

<br><br><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Expected fraction of late entries</b> defines how much space MeOS will reserve before (or after) the class to accommodate late entires. This is not a hard limit, but if there are more late entries than specified, there is no longer any guarantee that runners with similar courses do not start at the same time. If there will be no late entries, you should put this field to zero to get a more compact start field.
<br><br>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Distribute Times</b> constructs a suggestion for how the classes should be distributed to get a smooth flow of competitors. 
<br><br>
MeOS now presents the suggestion as a list together with some statistics. For each minute you see how many start there are, and the total start depth. The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Visualize Start Field</b> opens a windows and a graphical view over the classes.

<br><br>You can now make changes to the distribution. You can change <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">first start time</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">start interval</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">number of vacant positions</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">number of reserved places</b> (for late entries) in each class.
<br><br>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Update Distribution</b> will run the distribution algorithm again for those classes you didn't change, taking your changes into account. 
<br><br>
You can also select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Modify Settings</b>, to remake the distribution with other basic parameters. 
<br><br>
Finally, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Perform the Drawing</b> will draw all start lists for the selected classes, using the method you select.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Save Start Times</b> saves the currently set start times and intervals for each class, so that you may continue working later. When you perform the drawing, the settings are also automatically saved. Use the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Fetch Settings from Previous Session</b> to return to the previously used settings.</div>

<h3>Draw Late Entries</h3>
You can add start times for late entries to the selected classes by using the buttons <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Late Entries (Before)</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Late Entries (After)</b>. Before or after controls if the new start times are allocated before or after the existing times. To use this functinality, all selected classes need to have entries with assigned start times<br><a name="sec1948"></a><h3>Seeded Drawing</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-21</p>
Use seeded drawing when you want to use external parameters, such as ranking or results from previous stages, control the drawing process. Click on <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw / Manage Start Times</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>, and select the method <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Seeded start groups</b>.
<br><br>
First you must specify a source for the seeding. The options <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Points</b> use results from a previous stage. It is possible to enter such data manually by entering it (or pasting from Excel or similar) in the columns <i>Place in</i>, <i>Time in</i>, or <i>Points in</i> of the table on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>. The option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Ranking</b> assumes that ranking data is imported. Competitors without a ranking are placed after all ranked competitors.
<br><br>
Next you have to define the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Seeding groups</b>. You can specify a single number, which means the class is partitioned into a number of groups of this size. The number <i>1</i> means that each competitor is placed in a singleton group, and that in principle no randomness is involved in the drawing. (some randomness can still be involved when seeding data coincide for several competitors).
<br><br>
You can also explicitly list the group sizes. If you specify 15, 1000 you get a seeded group with 15 competitors, and the remaining competitors are drawn as usual.
<br><br>
You can <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">prevent competitors from the same club to start on adjacent start times</b> by checking this option. If the seeding result in two competitors on the same start time, the last of them will be moved down the list until the the conflict is resolved. If a single class dominates the club, it is not sure that the conflict can be resolved. MeOS will return a start order anyway.
<br><br>
Usually, the best seeded competitors will start last, but if you want to reverse the start order you can do so by checking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Let the highest ranked start first</b>.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start pairwise</b> means that competitors start pairwise.
<br><br>
Check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Assign bibs</b> and specify the first number of the class.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-10</p>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Cubs</i> it is possible to administer Clubs and invoices. To access this page you need to check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manage clubs and economy</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>. 
<br><br>
The commands <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Remove / Merge</b> is used to remove a club and move the members to some other club. This is useful if a club is created by mistake, for example by a spelling error. 

<div class="info"><b>Example</b><br><br>Consider the Swedish club IF Thor. By mistake, someone happens to type IF Tohr instead. To avoid having to change club of all competitors in Tohr, you can mark Tohr in the list, and select Remove / Merge. A second list is shown, and there you select IF Thor and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Merge</b>.</div>

Use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Update</b> to update the selected club with data (such as address and contact information) from the <i>Runner Database</i>. For this to work, the selected club must exist in the runner database, and be correctly spelled. See the section about the <a href="#sec1922" title="The runner database consists of a list with runners and a list with clubs. You typically use some external source for the data. If your country has Eventor, you can get the database automatically, see ...">Runner Database</a>.
If the runner database is installed when the club was created, this information is added automatically.
 
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Update all</b> does this update with all clubs. and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Update clubs &amp; runners</b> updates, in addition to all clubs, also the runners.
<br><br>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Delete all clubs</b> deletes all clubs from the competition. The teams and runners are kept, but without any club relation.

<br><br>
The commands <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Fees</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Invoice</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Create Invoices</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Summary</b> are explained in <a href="#sec1945" title="MeOS can create an invoices and an economic summary for the entire competition.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-03-10</p>
MeOS can create an invoices and an economic summary for the entire competition. The invoices are based on the fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Card Fee</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Entry Fee</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Paid</b> (see the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Table Mode</b>). Some forms support the option <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rent Card</b>, which means that the card fee is put to the value defined in <a href="#sec1946" title="You find the Competition Settings on sidan Competition. There you can enter the organizer's address information, and other general settings. 

...">Competition Settings</a>. 
<br><br>
There, you will also find contact information for the organizer, bank account number, and so on, needed to create the invoices.

<h3>Automatic Handling of Entry Fees</h3>
MeOS handles entry fees according to the following rules:
<ul><li>On the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>, you enter normal fees for youth classes, normal classes and elite classes. You can also enter a last date for normal entry and a fee raise in percent for a late entry.</li><li>When you add a new class, the fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Entry Fee</b> and  <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Late Entry Fee</b> gets values according to the competition settings and type of class. In addition, there are fields for a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">reduced fee</b>, which may be used for children and elderly people. You can set age limits under competition settings.</li><li>If you import a IOF-XML 3.0 entry file, it may contain fees that overrides your settings.</li><li>A new competitor automatically gets a fee from the class settings, entry date and age (if available, no fee reduction applies if age is missing. In classes where the fee depends on age, extra care must be taken to check and adjust the individual fee.)</li><li>If you change fees under Competition Settings, you have will get the option to update all fees for existing competitors and classes. If you change the fee for a class (Quick Settings, the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>), you get the option to update the fee for the class members.</li></ul>

<h3>Manual Fees</h3>
If you didn't enter or got all fees from start, there is a tool to manually assign fees. You find the tool on the page <i style="color:#008;">Clubs</i> under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Fees</b>. Here you can select a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">class type</b>, a lower and upper <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">date limit</b>, and the possibility to apply an <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">age filter</b>. You can also select to only assign fees to runners with no assigned fee.

To show which runners you settings would apply to, select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Show Selected Competitors</b>. To assign the fee to the selected competitors, click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Assign Fees</b>. To clear the fee, use instead <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Reset Fees</b>.
 
<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>The table mode on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i> and a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) is a powerful combination for advanced fee manipulation.</div>

<h3>Invoicing</h3>
To create an invoice, select a club from the list (the page <i style="color:#008;">Clubs</i>) and then  <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Invoice</b>. The invoice number is the club number. If you want to create more than one invoice at the time, there are several options. Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Create Invoices</b> and select a function from the list:

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Print All</b> creates a printing job with all invoices. The invoice number is a running number. The last page contains a summary with all invoices.</li><li>If you select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">export all to HTML</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">export all to PDF</b> you will first be asked to choose a folder. The invoices are saved there, named by the club. The summary is shown, which you can print or create a PDF from.</li></ul>

The function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Summary</b> brings up the summary without actually creating the invoices. 

<h3>Invoice settings</h3>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Invoice settings</b> takes you to a page with various settings. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First invoice number</b> lets you provide a first invoice number, all invoices are numbered sequentially starting with this number. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Organizer</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Payment details</b> are used to create the invoices. You may supply exact <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Coordinates</b> in for the address field, to fit it to a certain envelope. You can also supply <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Custom text lines</b> that print on each invoice. 

<h3>Fees for Relays and Multi Day Events</h3>
For relay and patrol competition, you can assign each competitor an individual fee, so that the fee for a team / patrol is the sum of the individual fees. It is also possible to add a fee for a team or patrol explicitly.
 
<br><br>
For competition with several stages, you should assign the total fee to each competitor, and only use the last stage to generate invoices. Otherwise there is one invoice for each stage. (If the majority of the competitors only run some of the stages, it might be easier to have separate invoices.)
<br><br>
When you transfer results to the following stage, you can transfer direct entries to persons with status <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Not taking part</b>. In that way, it is possible to get them into the final economical summary, see <a href="#sec1967" title="MeOS supports competitions with several stages, including traditional multi day events and competitions with prologue / pursuit in only some classes as well as more loosely tied competitions, where those that participated in all events get a final result based on the total time.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-03</p>
All MeOS computers connected to a competition takes an <b>automatic backup</b> of the entire competition everythird minute. The backup is saved in MeOS data folder. The path to this folder varies, but you can see it under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">settings</b>, which is available if you close down the competition.
<br><br>
You can restore an automatic backup by selecting <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Restore Backup</b> on the first page in MeOS. Then choose a competition from the list (which is sorted by name and time).
<br><br>If you want to create extra backups in a specific location, you may use  <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Interval Backup</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Services</i>. Select the location to save to and a time interval.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-17</p>
MeOS supports competitions with several stages, including traditional multi day events and competitions with prologue / pursuit in only some classes as well as more loosely tied competitions, where those that participated in all events get a final result based on the total time. 

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>To use this functionality, you need to <a href="#sec1934" title="When you create a new competition you have to choose which of MeOS feature you want to utilize. By clicking ...">activate support</a> for several stages.</div>

There is no built-in support for series based on points assigned according to some rules, or where only the best results count. A reason for that is that there seems to be as many sets of rules as there are such series. 
<br><br>
But you can use your own <a href="#sec1978" title="A Result Module can be used when you want to calculate result according to some specialized rules, for example:

...">Result Modules</a> and lists to directly produce result lists according to your own set of rules. To use the result of earlier stages as input, you must manually transfer incoming score to the table column <i>Points in</i>.<a name="sec1969"></a><h3>Preparations</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-03-18</p>
MeOS support for several stages is built on separate events for each stage. Every stage is a totally standalone competition, and different stages can run on independent computer systems without knowing of each other. To transfer results between stages, you have to save (import) both stages <i>locally</i> on one computer, where you transfer results from stage to the next. There are two typical usage scenarios:

<h3>Scenario One: All Stages Created from One Source</h3>
This approach is suitable when the competitors or teams registers for the entire competition (all stages) at once. You have one file with entires, and will use these for all stages.

<ul><li>Create the competition. This competition will be &quot;Stage 1&quot;.</li><li>Setup classes and import entries.</li><li>Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manage Several Stages</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i> (make sure to activate support for it under MeOS Features) and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Add New Stage</b>. A new competition is created, &quot;Stage 2&quot;, and all classes and competitors are copied to the new stage. The number of the stage is changed from &quot;No number&quot; to &quot;Stage 1&quot;.</li></ul> 

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>Assign bibs and draw the start list to add vacancies before creating several stages. Then the competitors will get the same bib in each stage. You can also cut and paste bibs between the stages using the table mode, but that is more complicated.</div>

If you later assign a vacant position or change class for a competitor, the next stage can automatically be updated with these changes when when you transfer results. However, you should not make major changes, like adding or splitting classes. Such changes must be manually transferred to the other stages, and the setup must be checked carefully for mistakes.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>Do not create the stages until the time for late entries is due, unless you use vacant positions for all late entires.</div>

If you need more stages, select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Open next</b> and repeat the procedure, until you got as many stages as is required.

<br><br>You can now treat each stage independently, as separate events. You can add courses, draw the start lists etc. 

<h3>Scenario Two: Loosely Tied Stages</h3>
If you prefer to make competitors (or teams) register independently entry for each stage, this is also possible to do in MeOS.

<ul><li>Create the first stage as a standalone competition.</li><li>Setup classes and import entries as usual.</li><li>Carry out the first stage. (This can be done now or later)</li><li>Create the second stage as a standalone competition.</li><li>Setup classes, courses, and import entries as usual. Make sure that class names match exactly. At this point, you have two independent competitions, with the same set of classes, and a set of competitors that partially overlap (but typically are not exactly the same).</li><li>Open Stage 1 and click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manage Several Stages</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i> (make sure to activate support for it under MeOS Features) and select the existing second stage in <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Next Stage</b> and change <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Ordinal of this Stage</b> to 1.</li><li>Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Open Next</b>. The changes are saved and the second competition is opened.</li><li>Ensure that the first stage is the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Preceding stage</b> and and that the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Ordinal of this stage</b> is 2.</li><li>Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Open Preceding</b>. MeOS opens stage 1 again.</li></ul> 

You have now connected the two independent competitions, and are ready to transfer results from stage 1 to stage 2, as soon as results from stage 1 are ready.
<br><a name="sec1970"></a><h3>Carry Out the Stage</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-03-20</p>
The principle to keep in mind is that you run a given stage exactly as an ordinary competition. Special steps are only needed to first setup the stage, and then to transfer results to the next stage.

<ul><li>Export the stage in XML-format from your computer (Use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Save as File</b>).</li><li>Import the file on the server that runs the stage (Use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Import Competition</b>).</li><li>Carry out the competition.</li><li>Save the competition to a file again (this time including stage results), and import this file on your <i>local computer</i>.</li></ul>

Now open the version of Stage 1 that has results. Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manage Several Stages</b> and verify that Stage 2 is selected in the list <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Next stage</b>. Then click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Transfer Results to the Next Stage</b>.

You have to decide on the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Treatment of competitors that have changed class</b>. Which of the following options is most suitable depends on the rules of your competition and if there was one entry list or separate registration for each stage:

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Switch to vacant position in the right class (if possible)</b>. Change class in the next stage to match this stage, provided there is a vacancy in the target class. If there is no vacant position, the current class is kept, but the competitor gets no total result. This option is suitable when the next stage already has drawn result lists.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Switch to the right class (keep start time)</b>. Change class in the next stage to match this stage. Do not change the start time.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Allow new class but without total result</b>. If the competitor has another class in the second stage, this class is kept, but no total result is given.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Allow new class and keep results from other class</b>. Keep the class and assign a total result, even if it originates from a different class.</li></ul>

If you have received new entries (in some classes) during the first stage and want to add them to the next stage, select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Specify classes where new entries are allowed</b>. MeOS shows a list where you can select classes. If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Transfer new competitors in remaining classes with status &lt;Not taking part&gt;</b> also new entries in other classes will be transferred, but are expected not to participate in the next stage. This option is primarily useful if you want to produce a collected invoice.

<br><br>
Open Stage 2 and check that the results were transferred as expected. On the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i> (and the page <i style="color:#008;">Teams</i>) there are boxes <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Results from Earlier Stages</b> with the fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Status</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Place</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Points</b> (if you have Rogaining support). You can manually adjust an incorrect value or you can modify the preceding stage and transfer the results again.
<br><br>
In <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Table Mode</b>, the columns <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time in</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Status in</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Points in</b> (for Rogaining) and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Place in</b> hold the transferred total result from the previous stage. 
<br><br>
Stage 2 is now ready to use. You can also assign start times with pursuit and similar schemes, see <a href="#sec1971" title="When drawing Stage 2 and later stages, there is a check box Use functions for multi stage class under ...">Special Start Time Assignment and Pursuit</a>. The lists <i>Stage Results</i> and <i>Total Results</i> includes the results you transferred to from the previous stage.<br><a name="sec1971"></a><h3>Special Start Time Assignment and Pursuit</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-08</p>
When drawing Stage 2 and later stages, there is a check box <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use functions for multi stage class</b> under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>. If you check this, you get access to the methods <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Pursuit</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Reversed pursuit</b>.  

<h3>Pursuit</h3>
Enter <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First start</b>. The leader start at this moment. Other competitors start at the time they are behind. You can apply a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">time scaling</b>; if you enter 0.5 all times will be scaled by the factor 0.5 &ndash; if you are 1 minute behind, you will start 30 seconds behind. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Maximum time after</b> specifies the maximum time (time scaling included) that the competitor at most may be behind the leader to be included in the pursuit. Everyone that has a longer total time start in an interval start (ordered by result). The first start time for the interval start is <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First time for restart</b> and you specify the interval in <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start interval</b>.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>Use 0:00 in the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Maximum time after</b> to create a seeded interval start where the best start first. In this case, the fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First start</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time scaling</b> have no effect. If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start pairwise</b>, the competitors will start in pairs.</div>

<h3>Reversed Pursuit</h3>
Reversed pursuit works similar to pursuit, but the interpretation of the fields is slightly modified.
<br><br>
Those less than <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Maximum time after</b> the leader starts in a reversed pursuit, e.g., the person with the longest time starts first (at the moment specified by <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First start</b>) and the leader starts last (when depends on how much longer time the person that started first has).
<br><br>
Competitors that did not pass the previous stages, or are longer after than the maximum time, start in the interval start beginning at <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First time for restart</b>. This time may be set to before or after the first start. Competitors that did not pass earlier stages start at the end.
<br><br>
You can use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time scaling</b> and you can put <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Maximum time after</b> to 0:00 for a reversed seeded start order. You can also use pairwise start.
<br><a name="sec1968"></a><h3>Results</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-08</p>
You can publish results and splits just as for a one day competition. There are also two lists adapted for several stages. The list <i>Stage results</i> presents the stage result and total result in the same list. The list <i>Final results</i> includes only the total result.<br><br><a name="sec1949"></a><h2 class="break">Speaker Module</h2>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-08</p>
To access the speaker module, check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use Speaker Module</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>.
<br><br>
First you need to select which classes and controls you wish to monitor. Go to <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Settings</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Speaker</i>. There are no other settings needed, and you may change which classes or controls you monitor at any time. The settings you make are not saved in the competition, but applies only in the MeOS session where they are applied.
<br><br>
Now you get a row with buttons for the <b>selected classes</b> and some other functionality. When you select a class, <a href="#sec1954" title="When you select a class, you will see an additional row of button with the selected controls that exist in the class.

</li></ul><a name="sec1956"></a><h3>Live Results &ndash; Stopwatch</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2016-01-20</p>
The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Live Results</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Speaker</i> open a new window, where you choose classes and a start control and a finish control for the stop watch. Then move the window to the screen where you want to show the stop watch in full screen and press <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start</b> (or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Enter</b> on your keyboard).
<br><br>
MeOS switches to full screen mode for that screen, and when a competitor in a watched class punches at the start control, a stopwatch starts, showing the time until the finish control is reached. Currently, MeOS can only handle one competitor at the time. To exist the full screen mode, focus on the full screen windows and press <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Esc</b> on the keyboard.
<br><br>
For this to work, the start and finish control must be connected to the competition (obviously) and the connection should be so quick that there is no long delay between the punching and the information reaching MeOS. You should activate MeOS support for sending and receiving fast advance information on control punches.
<br><a name="sec1953"></a><h3>Event View</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-06</p>
In the Event View, MeOS reports events for the selected classes, as the competitions proceeds. This enables you to monitor several classes and radio controls in one view. The event view includes:

<ul><li>For each passing, the current place and if the competitor has gained or lost time since the previous passing.</li><li>When finishing (after card readout), information a summary on time lost and control mistakes.</li><li>In a relay, the names of incoming and outgoing team members.</li><li>For team competitions, both relevant individual results and the total team result.</li></ul>

You can filter the number event shown (<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">All events</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Important events</b> or only <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Decisive events</b>) and how long history is included.

Decisive events affects top three in each class. The level might be appropriate if many classes will be monitored at the same time. Important events means top ten in each class. <br><a name="sec1954"></a><h3>Class View</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-08</p>
When you select a class, you will see an additional row of button with the selected controls that exist in the class. If the class has several legs (e.g. a relay) you must also select which leg watch.
<br><br>
When you have selected a control (and leg) you will see a list with the class members, distributed under the headings <b>Results</b>, <b>Incoming</b> and <b>Others</b>. The result list is at the top and includes (initially) the competitors that have punched the control/finished. In the list of incoming, you see the list of competitors expected to the control, sorted by running time.
<br><br>
If you want to watch a runner more carefully, click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Watch</b>. The runner will be sorted into the list results, without a place but with running time. When the competitor is registered at the control, the time is fixed and the current place is shown instead.
<br><br>
If the list with results becomes too long, you can select to <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Move Down</b> uninteresting competitors. They will be sorted into the list Others, at the bottom.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-08</p>
The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manual Times</b> brings you to a page where you can manually enter times. Specify a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Control</b> by entering its <i>punching code</i>. To specify the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Runner</b> you can use the <i>bib</i> (you may also specify the card number). 
<br><br>
You can optionally enter a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time</b> formated HH:MM:SS, but you can also leave the field blank to use the current time of the computer.<br><a name="sec1951"></a><h3>Automatic Radio Times</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2014-04-24</p>
MeOS supports electronic radio controls. Program a master station as a control or finish and make sure <i>send punches / auto send</i> is active (see your SportIdent documentation).  
<br><br>
Now go to the page <i style="color:#008;">SportIdent</i> in MeOS. Make sure <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">readout / radio</b> is selected. Choose the COM port to which the unit is connected and then click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Activate</b>. MeOS will try to contact the unit, but if the control is far away or connected via a radio link, it is not certain MeOS will get a response.
<br><br>
You are then asked if you want MeOS to listen to incoming punches. If you answer yes, MeOS will listen to the selected port. To verify the connection, you have to test punch. MeOS cannot detect if the contact with the SI unit is lost.

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>You may connect a finish, start, check or clear unit in the same way as you connect controls (It is for example possible to clear card at the same time they are assigned to competitors). If MeOS gets a response from the master station, it will tell MeOS how it is programmed. If MeOS does not get any response and listens to incoming punches, it is not possible to determine what type of unit is connected. MeOS makes the following assumption:
<ul><li>A code number greater than 30 is interpreted as a control.</li><li>Code number 1 is assumed to be from a start unit.</li><li>Code number 3 is assumed to be a from check unit or clear unit.</li><li>Other code number less than 30 are interpreted as a finish punch.</li></ul>
Here are some further rules explaining how MeOS will use incoming punches:
<ul><li>If a start punch is registered for a competitor, the start time is set.</li><li>A check or clear punch will not affect the result, but it is taken into consideration when determining which runners remain in forest.</li><li>Punches used to assign cards to competitors are not saved in the competition in any way; the result is the same as if the number was entered manually.</li></ul></div>


To enter radio times via an Internet connection, you can use <a href="#sec1933" title="Remote input on sidan Services let you fetch punches and read out cards from the Internet. Supply the address, ...">Remote Input and Radio Times from the Internet</a>.
<br><br>
MeOS also supports the protocol <i>SI Online Punches</i>, which means punches can be sent over a network, thought mobile communications or the Internet. Choose <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">TCP</b> in the list of ports. You have to use the same port for TCP as the program that send the punches. MeOS assumes that the zero time of the protocol is 00:00:00. Press <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Starta</b> to open the port. 
<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>Make sure any firewall involved will let though the traffic when using SI Online Punches.</div><br><a name="sec1952"></a><h3>Editing Punches</h3>

MeOS support relays of different kinds as well as other special forms of competitions, such as patrol, individuals forks, an integrated prologue + pursuit. Any class with more than one course or leg are collectively referred to as a multi class.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>You can mix multi classes and normal individual classes in the same competition.</div>

Ensure that the functionality you need to use is activated under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">MeOS features</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>.

<br><br>
<h3>Individual Classes with Forked Courses</h3>
If you have activated forked courses but not team classes, you will find the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Courses with Forks</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>. Clicking it shows the settings for individual classes:

<h3>Team Classes</h3>
If you have activated support for any kind of team class, you will find the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Several Courses / Relay</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>. This starts the guide <i>Changing Legs</i>, which is used to define a multi class.

You can select from a number of predefined forms of competition. For some of the forms, you need to provide data for <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start time</b> and/or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Number of Legs</b>. The following options exist (depending on which functionality you have activated).

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-22</p>
A leg in a class has an <i>ordered</i> set of courses. These are assigned to the competitors, rolling, by start number. 
<div class="info"><h3>Example</h3>
Suppose there are three courses, A, B and C. Runner 1 gets course A, runner 2 course B, runner 3 course C, runner 4 course A, runner 5 course B, and so on. To fork a relay with thre legs and three courses, you can assign courses ABC to leg 1, BCA to leg 2, and CAB to leg 3. 
<br><br>
But this is not optimal. You will get more out of the forking if you put ABCABC on leg 1, BCACAB on leg 2 and CABBCA on leg 3. Then there are six possible orders to run the course: ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, and CBA. These are all possible orders over three courses.</div>

<h3>Dynamically Tied Courses</h3>
If you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use course pool</b>, the forking will not be locked until the competitor finishes. MeOS will then select a course, from the set of courses specified on the leg, that matches the punches in the card. This assignment is made independently for each runner, and no check is made that the team as a whole has run all forkings.
<br><br>
If instead you check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Out of order parallel legs</b>, MeOS will allow that within a team and for each group of parallel legs, any competitor can have any of the team's forkings.
<br><br>
For example, if leg 3 is parallel with four different courses (and four runners), it will not matter which of the runners take which course. However, MeOS will check that all the specified courses are run, only a different order is allowed.

<h3>Defining Forkings</h3>
The function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Define Forking</b> lets you easily construct an optimal forking key based on the courses you have. Select a number of course variants, the legs that should use these courses and then click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Assign Selected Courses to Selected Legs</b>. If other legs are supposed to use a different set of courses, you have to repeat this procedure until all legs has the right set of courses assigned. Then you click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Calculate and Apply Forking</b>. MeOS computes an optimal forking key from the courses; the result is best of the courses are forked with each other with certain common controls.
<br><br>
If you want to view the complete forking schemes for the teams as units, click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Show Forking</b>. You will also get further information if unfairness is detected. 

On the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> there is a list with the course assignment. For each competitor you see the assigned course. 

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>On the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> there is also a list with a table format. Copy this list and past it into a word processor or spreadsheet program to create labels with bib, course and leg, suitable to label maps.</div>
<br><a name="sec1961"></a><h3>Managing Teams</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-18</p>
On the page <i style="color:#008;">Teams</i>, visible when you have defined a class with a team, you manage teams and team line-ups. For the selected team, you can directly enter team name, bib, the team class and status. You can also directly enter or change name and card number for all team members. To remove a runner from a leg, you can simply erase the name.
<br><br>
In many cases you want to move existing competitors between legs and teams, for example when processing late team changes. Click the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">&lt;&gt;</b> (Tie a runner to the leg) corresponding to the leg you want to change. You will be presented with a list of competitors that you can tie to the leg. If the selected leg already has a competitor tied to it and the new competitor also has a leg in some team, the competitors will switch legs. By making a sequence of these switches you can quickly achieve the desired  changes without having to enter names and card numbers again.

<br><br>
The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">...</b> (Edit competitor) lets you view the competitor on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>The team forking is controlled by the start number, which is usually the same as the bib. Therefore, if you assign new bibs, the forking will be modified.</div> 

If you want to change the team forking, it possible to change the start number manually (but keeping the bib). This is what the function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Change Team Forking</b> does. You will select from a list of forking keys (which corresponds to a line in the course definition for the class). When you save the new key, MeOS will modify the start number accordingly.
<a name="sec1962"></a><h4>Team Line-Ups</h4>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-17</p>
You can import team line-ups from IOX-XML (Eventor) but you can also import from a simple text format.

<br><br>Choose <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Import Team Line-Ups</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Teams</i>. You need to specify a file with team data, separated by semicolon according to a certain format:

<ul><li>First comes a line with class, team name, and optionally a club.</li><li>Then, there is a row for each member of the team, where you specify name, card number, club, course, and competitor's class (that latter is only possible when the leg type is <i>group</i>, otherwise the competitor's class is always the same as the team class).</li><li>Card number, club, and course are optional</li><li>The class must exist, and there must be exactly one row for leg in the team. Use empty rows if necessary.</li></ul>

</p>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Use competitor's already in competition</b> means that competitors that already exist in the competition will be matched and moved to the team. Unmatched competitors will be ignored.

<h3>Import Patrols (Multi Sport)</h3>
There is a specialized import format for patrols. The file is separated by semicolon and the first row must be <tt>RAIDDATA</tt>. Then follows one row for each patrol: start number, team name, city, entry date, class name, class id, competitor 1, competitor 2, index for sorting. You import this file by specifying its source under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Entries</b> (Import Data)on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>. Classes are created automatically.

 Example:

The command <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Appoint Anonymous Team Members</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Teams</i> creates anonymous team members (named X) on all legs where there the team line-up is not given. Later, you will typically replace these placeholders with the real team members.
<br><br>
A reason to create temporary team members can be that you need them to draw start times or to assign card numbers or entry fees.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-28</p>

If none of the predefine form of competitions suite you needs, you can change the rules for each leg manually.
Select a class on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>. If it is a multi class, you will see a table like form with settings for each leg, see the section on <a href="#sec1957" title="MeOS support relays of different kinds as well as other special forms of competitions, such as patrol, individuals forks, an integrated prologue + pursuit. Any class with more than one course or leg are collectively referred to as a multi class.

...">multi classes</a>. The possible settings are explained below.

<br><br>

<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Leg type</b> decides the rules for the leg and how results are calculated. There are the following options.

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Normal</b> means that the leg is run after the preceding leg has finished.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Parallel</b> means that the leg runs in parallel with the  <i>preceding</i> leg (which may or may not in turn be parallel with its preceding leg). The start time is assumed to be the same. The time on the leg is the maximum of the time for any runner in the parallel block; the last of the parallel runners change over to the next leg. If you want three parallel legs, number one, two, and three, use normal for leg one and parallel for leg two and three.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Optional</b> works just like parallel with one difference: it is allowed for a team to <i>not</i> have any runner on that leg. The type can be used in a class where you can run individually or in a patrol. In the patrol case, it is the runner with longest time that decides the time of the patrol.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Extra</b> is another variant of parallel or optional. The difference is that the <i>fastest</i> time is used to define the start time for the next leg; the runner first to finish defines the time on the leg; the results of the other extra runners are ignored.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Sum</b> means that the leg time of the the time on the leg is added to the team time, disregarding the time elapsed from team start time to finish time of leg. This is required when the relay does not run linearly from start to finish, for example if there is a break. If you use this kind of leg, there is in general no guarantee that first to finish will win.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Co-runner</b> means that the runner is included in the lists, but is completely ignored when calculating results. A co-runner need not have a a SI-card.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Group</b> means that the competitor is a member of the team, but runs his/her own race in his/her own class (which may be an individual class). MeOS has no rule for calculating the team result; This option is useful when you have defined a <a href="#sec1978" title="A Result Module can be used when you want to calculate result according to some specialized rules, for example:

...">Result Module</a> that defines the rules. Please note that a competitor may belong to at most one team.</li></ul>

The field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start type</b> defines how the leg starts using the following options.

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start time</b> means that the time supplied in the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start time</b> will be used for all runners on the leg.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Changeover</b> means that the finish time on the previous leg is used as start time. Note that the leg types parallel, optional, and extra have special rules for which time is used.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Assigned</b> mean that MeOS will not modify the start time automatically. You are responsible for assigning start time by drawing the leg, using a start punch, or some other method.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Pursuit</b> means that the result of the preceding legs are used to setup a pursuit. The first runner in the pursuit starts at the time specified at <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start time</b>.</li></ul>

In the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start time</b> you can specify the start time (when the start type is start time) or the first start time (when the start time is pursuit). When the start type is <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Changeover</b> you can either specify <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Ordered</b>, which means that the runners will start in the order of the team line-up, or specify a leg. For parallel legs, ordered means that the runner that finishes first on the preceding leg will send out the runner that is listed first on the next leg, and so on. By instead specifying a leg, you say that the runner must be sent out by that specified runner. For example you can specify that leg 1 sends out leg 3 and leg 2 sends out leg 4, no matter who finishes first of leg 1 and leg 2.
<br><br>
The field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Runner</b> decides which team member will run the leg. The normal case for a rely is that this number is the same as the leg number. But you can select the runner of a previous leg, which means this runner will run again. For example, if you want the same runner to run, say, leg one and three, select <i>Leg 1</i> in this field for leg three.

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>The team settings are quite flexible and therefore quite complicated. If you are organizing a relay with special rules, you should make a small test competition to ensure that you and MeOS agrees on how the rules are interpreted.</div>

The fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rope</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Restart</b> are explained in the section <a href="#sec1958" title="The fields Rope and Restart, which is defined for each leg, or both about restarting teams that has taken too long time to complete earlier legs, or failed. Both fields expects a real time. The fields are only used when the start time of the runner depends on the earlier results.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-17</p>
The fields <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rope</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Restart</b>, which is defined for each leg, or both about restarting teams that has taken too long time to complete earlier legs, or failed. Both fields expects a real time. The fields are only used when the start time of the runner depends on the earlier results.
<br><br>
If the time for change over occurs after the <i>rope time</i>, the change over time will not define the start time. Instead the <i>restart time</i> will be used. To be concrete, you close the change over (drawing a more or less virtual rope) at the rope time. At the restart time, you let the remaining runners start. You can use different restart and rope times on different legs, if needed.
<br><br>
Note that for a <b>pursuit</b>, the rope time refers to a time in the pursuit, not to a time for finish in the preceding leg.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br><ul><li>In most cases, you want to have the same restart on several legs and in several classes. To this end, you can use the function <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Restart</b> (under functions).

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-12-21</p>
<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>To use this functionality, you must first <a href="#sec1934" title="When you create a new competition you have to choose which of MeOS feature you want to utilize. By clicking ...">activate it</a>.</div>

MeOS supports Rogaining (collecting points by visiting controls) in two ways:

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Time Limit</b>, meaning you have a maximal time to visit as many controls as possible. Overtime implies point reduction. Winner is the person with the highest score. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Point reduction for each started minute</b> that the whole point reduction is given for each started minute overtime.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Point limit</b>, which means that in order to pass, you need to score at least a certain number of points. Winner is the person with the shortest time.</li></ul>

You setup rogaining rules per course on the page <i style="color:#008;">Courses</i>. The course must list all controls that are included, but the order does not matter since rogaining controls may be visited in any order.
<br><br>
You can mix normal orienteering and sections with rogaining in the same course (presumably using a point limit). For example, in the middle of the course, there is a cluster of rogaining controls, and a certain number of points must be reached before you are allowed to continue the course.
<br><br>
On the page the page <i style="color:#008;">Controls</i> you need to specify that a certain control is a roganing control, by changing the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Status</b> to <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rogaining</b> and defning how many <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Rogaining points</b> the control awards.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>You can let the same (physical) control play different roles on different courses, by creating several controls with the same SI-code but with different status and/or rogaining ponits. Different courses can then refer to different representations of the same controls.</div>

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-30</p>
MeOS has a direct connection to an Eventor server, which you can use if your country uses Eventor. You need an Eventor API key that you from your club's Eventor administrator. You will enter the key the first time you try to access Eventor.

<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>The API key should be handled with care. When you enter the key in MeOS, it is stored in an encrypted format, which makes it hard but not impossible to decode. To erase the key, select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Competition from Eventor</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Connection Settings</b> and leave the field for the API key blank.</div>

MeOS uses Eventor to automatically fetch classes and entries for your competition. Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Competition from Eventor</b> on the first page. Select the competition from the list of competitions and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Next</b>. Unless you are sure that your database is up to date, you should let MeOS update it.
<br><br>
In the next step, you have to input first start time and start method. If you select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Simultaneous start</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Drawn start list</b> MeOS will create a start list for you automatically. Otherwise, that task is left to you.
<br><br>
If you have access to courses exported from OCAD or Condes, you should supply the file here. MeOS will import the courses and try to tie the classes to the right class.
<br><br>
Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Fetch Data from Eventor</b> to complete the import.
<br><br>
In a competition from Eventor there is a button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Eventor Connection</b> on the page the page <i style="color:#008;">Competition</i>. You can choose to <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Fetch Late Entries</b>,

The latter two options uploads the start list and result / split times to Eventor. The split times may be automatically published on WinSplits Online (if your version of Eventor supports this).

<br><br>
When you create a new competition and the Eventor Connection is activated, MeOS will check if the runner database is dated. If so, MeOS asks if you wish to update it. You can also update the database manually, by selecting <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Competition from Eventor</b> on the first page, but only check the option to update the runner database.

You cannot change some cells, and for some cells you have to select the value from a drop down list.</li><li><b>Sort</b> the values in a column by click the column heading. Click again to reverse the sorting.</li><li><b>Filter</b> the shown rows by clicking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Filter...</b> in a column, and typing a string you want to match. The result shows while you type. For example, you can show only a specific class in the table <i>Competitors</i> by typing the class name in the filter for the class column.</li><li><b>Choose Columns</b> which is a accessed through the corresponding button in the tool box. Mark the columns you wish to see, and press <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">OK</b>.</li><li><b>Reorder</b> the columns by drawing and releasing the column headings in the new position.</li><li><b>Mark cells</b> by clicking and drawing a rectangle. You can copy the selection to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) or delete the corresponding rows (Del). If you copy cells, you can paste the result to a spreadsheet program.</li><li>You can <b>Paste</b> data from a spreadsheet program (Ctrl+V). If you did not mark any cells, the rows are added to the table. If the number of columns in the clipboard is less than the number of columns in the table, remaining columns get default values. If you did mark cells in the tables, the selected cells are overwritten with data from the clipboard.</li><li>You can <b>Print</b> the table (Ctrl+P)</li><li>You can <b>Add a Row</b> to the table (Ctrl+I)</li><li>You cab <b>Refresh</b> the table (F5). Tables in MeOS are not updated automatically, to avoid distractions when working with them. Press F5, or the button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Refresh</b> to update the table with external changes.</li></ul>

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-14</p>
You can design your own list if none of the built in lists suits you. You can adapt the layout, font and text size, and the actual contents. You find the list editor on the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Edit List</b>. 

<br><br>Editing a list requires a certain understanding of how the list system works. Read the documentation first to get a feeling for how it works. To get started you might want to examine an existing list to see how it is constructed. Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Open from This Competition</b> to open one of the built in competitions.<a name="sec1973"></a><h3>Basic Principles</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2012-11-15</p>
A list is built from four <i>parts</i>.

<ul><li><i>Heading</i> is the main title of the list(for example Results).</li><li><i>Subheading</i> is typically the class name, or something similar. The contents of the subheading should match the list type and global sort order, which you set in <a href="#sec1974" title=" The button Properties brings you to a form with global settings for the entire list.

* MeOS uses List name to refer to the list. This text is not visible in the actual list. to refer to t......">Properties of a List</a>. The sub heading is repeated each time its contents is changed.</li><li><i>Main list</i> usually contains the name of a competitor or team and other informations (such as place or time). The contents of the main list should match the selected list type, meaning that if the list type is <i>competitor</i> every row in the list should correspond to a competitor &ndash; if the list type is <i>team</i> every row should be about a certain team.</li><li>Finally, there is a <i>sublist</i> that you only need occasionally. The sublist may show intermediate times (for a competitor) or team members (for teams). The contents must match the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Secondary type</b>, which you also control under <a href="#sec1974" title=" The button Properties brings you to a form with global settings for the entire list.

* MeOS uses List name to refer to the list. This text is not visible in the actual list. to refer to t......">Properties</a>.</li></ul>

In each part there is a number of <i>rows</i>, and each row contains a number of <i>list entries</i>. Each list entry has a <i>type</i>, for example <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Class name</b>, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Team's bib</b> or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Competitor's time</b>.

<br><br>When the list is generated, every list entry is replaced with the corresponding text. The list <a href="#sec1974" title=" The button Properties brings you to a form with global settings for the entire list.

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2016-01-15</p>
 The button <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Properties</b> brings you to a form with global settings for the entire list.

<ul><li>MeOS uses <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">List name</b> to refer to the list. This text is not visible in the actual list.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">List type</b> is the type that every row in the main list refers to. Possible choices are: <i>Competitor</i>, <i>Team</i>, <i>Club (competitor)</i>, <i>Competitor (classes together)</i>, <i>Competitor (specific leg)</i>, <i>Team (classes together)</i>, <i>Course</i>, and <i>Control</i>.
<br><br>
The type Club / Competitor works as the option Competitor, but the list is grouped by club. 

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>If you want to make a list of clubs, use this type, but leave the main list empty and use blocks in the subheading as the main list.</div>

The types Competitor and team with <i>classes together</i> works together with <a href="#sec1978" title="A Result Module can be used when you want to calculate result according to some specialized rules, for example:

...">Result Modules</a>. The options mean the the competitor's (team's) classes are merged when the results are calculated. The classes you select when showing the list are included in the calculation.

<div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>If you want to create a common result list for the classes Men and Women, you can do as follows:
<ul><li>Create a Result Module with standard rules.</li><li>Create a result list of the type <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Competitor (classes together)</b>. Select the result module from the previous step. Save the list in the competition.</li><li>Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">All Lists</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i>. Choose the list and the classes you want to include in the calculation.</li><li>When the list shows, you can select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Remember the List</b> to save it with the class selection.</li></ul></div>
<i>Competitor (specific leg)</i> is also used together with a result module, and means that each leg (in a relay) is treated as its own class.

The choices <i>Course</i> and <i>Control</i> creates lists over courses and controls. Such a list can be used to view course usage, for example.
</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result calculation</b> is used to define how results are calculated. Standard is the default method, which, depending on the contents of the list and the class definition, means individual result, team result, total result or Rogaining result. You may also define a custom method for result calculations, see <a href="#sec1978" title="A Result Module can be used when you want to calculate result according to some specialized rules, for example:

...">Result Modules</a></li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Global sort order</b> defines the order of the rows in the list. The order should agree with the contents in the subheading. If the sort order starts with class, the blocks in the subheading should contain class types, such as class name. Note that teams does not support all sort orders. Here follows a description of some common orders:
<ul><li><b>Class, start time, name</b> is used for start lists.</li><li><b>Class, result (total result)</b> is used for normal result lists. Total result sums the result of all stages.</li><li><b>Start time, name</b> is used for minute start lists and similar lists</li><li><b>Custom order</b> can be used when you have selected your own result module. The order defined by the module is used.</li><li><b>Reversed finish time</b> Place the latest result first. This kind of lists, set to show the first 30 lines or so, can be suitable to show a recent result list on a screen near the finish.</li></ul></li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Secondary type</b> is used to define a sublist for each row in the main list, for example split times for a competitor, or the members of a team.</li><li>
<b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Support time from control</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Support time to control</b> makes the corresponding options available when showing the list (thus, you can the use the list to see results from start to control 50 or similar.). For this to work, you need a result module supporting these options. Two built-in result modules that you can use are <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result at control</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;"> Total/team result at a control</b>.</li><li>
Use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Filtering</b> to exclude rows from the list. A result list usually only contains competitors with a result. Use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">With result</b> to only include runners with a definite result status, or <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Prel. result</b> to also include runners with a finish punch, but which has not yet read out their card (and assuming the status will be OK). 
<br><br>
If you want to show only vacant start times, use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Only vacant</b>. If you want to exclude vacant positions, use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Not vacant</b>.
<br><br>You can also show competitors with or without a card, or with a borrowed card. Use <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Has started</b> to only show entries without DNS status.</li><li> 
A <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Sub Filter</b> is used when the secondary list type is of <i>Competitor</i> type. Most of these filters work as the corresponding filters on the main list. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Collect parallel legs</b> groups parallel legs, that is, shows all parallel legs when a leg is selected. <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Collect parallel legs, skip first</b> is similar, but skips the first leg of the group. This is useful when the data corresponding to the first line is shown in the main list.</li><li>
Under <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Type face</b> you can select the type face (font) for every part of the list, and scale the relative size with the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Scale factor</b>. You must make sure that any computer using the list can use the selected font (otherwise, some other font will be used.). If you export the list to HTML, the font is also used. To show as intended the font must exist on the computer that views the web list. You can also specify a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Distance</b> that is added to the default distance to the previous line. It is also possible to specify a negative number.</li></ul>
<br><a name="sec1975"></a><h3>List Entries</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-18</p>

You add a list entry by clicking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Add New</b> on a row (first you need to ad the row: <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Add Row</b>). Use the commands <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Move Right</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Move Left</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Delete</b>, to modify the order and remove list entries from rows.

<h3>A List Entry Has the Following Properties</h3>

<ul><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Type</b> defines the contents of the entry. The type <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Text</b> lets you define the entire text yourself. For all other types, MeOS will put in the corresponding text when the list is generated.</li><li>In the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Custom text</b> you can type a custom string. If you leave this field blank, you get only the text generated by MeOS. If you provide a string, use the character <b>X</b> to place the generated text. The entry of type <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Course length for course</b> constitute a good example. You can type <p class="code">X meters</p> or <p class="code">X m</p> depending on if you prefer <i>2500 meter</i> or <i>2500 m</i> in the list (given a class with this length). If you provide course lengths in some other unit, like Inches, Feet, or &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m, this feature is also useful.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Align with</b> lest you align the list entry horizontally with a list entry in some other row. To adjust with a list post of type Text, you need to the corresponding text in the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Text</b>.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Adjust block-wise</b> means that text takes at least the size specified by the block size. Any text above which is anchored inside the block (i the vertical coordinate) is pushed to the right and anchored where the block ends.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Data from result module</b> check this option if you want to take data, for example time and place, from the result module you have defined under <a href="#sec1974" title=" The button Properties brings you to a form with global settings for the entire list.

For a patrol start list, it is of interest to access name, card number, etc for the first and second competitor. You can do this either by using a sublist (which give one row for each patrol member). If you want everything on the same row, you can access the individual legs on the team row with this property.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Merge with previous</b> means the the text of the entry is appended to the text of the entry to the left, instead of getting its own column. No blank space is added by MeOS, so usually you need to use a <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Custom text</b>: for a simple blank space, write &quot;&nbsp;X&quot;. When this option is active, other formatting settings, such as color, adjustment and indentation, will be inherited from the list entry to the left.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Text adjustment</b> lets you select if the text in the column will be left adjusted, right adjusted or centered.</li><li><b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Color</b> lets you set the text color.</li></ul>

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>Some fields, such a bib number and ranking, are automatically excluded if no competitor has a bib (or ranking). Other fields may change format depending on the competition. The start time, for example, is formatted without seconds when all competitors start at whole minutes. <br><br>The width of the fields are automatically adjusted so that all fields have enough space. However, this adjustment is only made when the list is loaded, not at an automatic update. In normal cases this has no practical implication, but if you experience problems, you should close the list and open it again.</div><br><a name="sec1976"></a><h3>Data from Result Modules</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-03-27</p>
If you use a <a href="#sec1978" title="A Result Module can be used when you want to calculate result according to some specialized rules, for example:

...">Result Module</a> to calculate results for the list, you activate out data from the module by checking <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Data from result module</b> in a list entry. Not all types of list entries supports data from a result module; basically it calculates a time, a status, and a point, so only types related to these quantities and some deduced quantities, such as place and time after, supports data from a result module.
<br><br>
In addition there is another way to print out data from the result module in the list. In your code, you may assign values to the variables <tt>OutputTimes[]</tt> and <tt>OutputNumbers[]</tt>, which you can pick up in the list through the types <i>Result Module: Time</i> and <i>Result Module: Number</i>, respectively.

<h3>Result Module: Time</h3> This type formats the number in <tt>OutputTimes[index]</tt> (seconds), as a time. You specify which index to use in <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Index in OutputTimes[index]</b>.

<h3>Result Module: Number</h3> This type formats the number in <tt>OutputNumbers[index]</tt> as a number. But you can also use the number to select any text string: In the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Custom text</b>, type <tt>@</tt> followed by a semicolon separated list of values. Then <tt>OutputNumbers[index]</tt> will be used as a (zero based) index to select one of the strings. If a string in the list contains the symbol <tt>X</tt>, it will be replaced by the number. If the last string in the list contains <tt>X</tt>, this string will be used also for any number not covered by the list. Thus you can use the string <tt>@;X</tt> to make 0 blank and print the number otherwise.

<h3>Example</h3>
Suppose that you, in the rule for time calculation, in your result module enter:
<p class="code">OutputNumbers[0] = Place-1;<br />
return Time;</p>
Then you select this result module in the list properties, create a list entry and select <i>Result Module: Number</i>, puts the index to 0 (default), and in the field <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Custom text</b> type <tt>@Gold;Silver;Bronze</tt>. <br><br>
The outcome is that the winners get the text <i>Gold</i>, those at a second place get <i>Silver</i> and those at a third place get <i>Bronze</i>. Other gets nothing.<br><br><a name="sec1978"></a><h2 class="break">Result Modules</h2>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-18</p>
A <i>Result Module</i> can be used when you want to calculate result according to some specialized rules, for example:

<ul><li>Time punishment for a punch at an incorrect control</li><li>A team competition where the first team with a specified number of runners to the finish wins.</li><li>A time bonus for leg wins.</li><li>Punish controls&mdash;extra controls that must be visited if a certain criterion is met.</li></ul> In short, almost anything can be done.
<br><br>
A result module consists of a set of rules written in MRL (MeOS Result Language). You create and work with result modules on the page <i style="color:#008;">Lists</i> through the function  <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result Modules</b>. 

<br><br>Once you have written a result module, you need to create a <a href="#sec1972" title="You can design your own list if none of the built in lists suits you. You can adapt the layout, font and text size, and the actual contents. You find the list editor on ...">list</a> that specifies your result module in <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result calculation</b> under list properties. 
<br><br>In most cases you also want to sort the list according to the result calculation, and then you also have to select <i>Custom order</i> in the setting <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Global sort order</b>. In addition, you must check <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Data from result module</b> for each list entry that should use data calculated by the module.
<br><br>
This requirement may seem unnecessary, but allows you for example to create a list based on a time calculated by the result module, but also shows the unadjusted (actual) time within parenthesis.
<a name="sec1980"></a><h3>Result Rules</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-20</p>
There are two sets of rules in a result module: one for individual races and one for teams. The purpose of the two sets are the similar, but what <a href="#sec1981" title="Here follows the list of symbols defined by MeOS. Vector symbols are indicated by a square bracket, []...">symbols</a> are available differs between competitors and teams. For a competitors there is for example the symbol <tt>Course</tt>, which is the course, but a team has <tt>RunnerTime[]</tt>, which contains the running time for each team member.
<br><br>
It is not necessary to write code for every rule. In many cases the standard rule will work. And if your result module only is for individual races, there is no point in writing code for the rules for team result calculation.

<h3>Status Calculation</h3>
The Status rule calculates the status of the competitor or team (OK, Disqualified etc.). The standard rule returns the symbol Status, which is the symbol for the status according to default rules. Thus method must return one of the symbols: <tt>StatusOK</tt>, <tt>StatusDNS</tt>, <tt>StatusMP</tt>, <tt>StatusDNF</tt>, <tt>StatusDQ</tt>, <tt>StatusMAX</tt>, <tt>StatusUnknown</tt>, or <tt>StatusNotCompetiting</tt>.

<h3>Time Calculation</h3>
This method is used to calculate the time, in seconds, for the competitor or team. The standard rule returns the symbol <tt>Time</tt>.

<h3>Point Calculation</h3>
The method is used to calculate the points (or some other number) for the competitor or team. The interpretation of these points depends entirely on the method result score as defined below.

<h3>Result Score Calculation</h3>
This is the most important method. It is used to calculate an internal score which is used to sort the competitors or teams and then to assign a place. A lower score means a better place; a negative score is better than any positive score. Equal score implies a shared place.
<br><br>
The default method returns <tt>Time</tt> if the status is OK, otherwise <tt>900000 + Status</tt>. The fastest time gets the lowest score and wins. If the status is not OK, the score is higher than the score for any runner with status OK.<br><a name="sec1979"></a><h3>MRL &ndash; MeOS Result Language</h3>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-20</p>
MRL (MeOS Result Language) is a programming language used to describe result calculations. To create custom result calculation rules, some basic programming skill is required. If you have write any program fragment in Java, PHP, C++, C# r a similar language, you probably possess all necessary skills.

<h3>The Fundamentals</h3>
A MRL routine consists of a sequence if statements, separated by semicolon (;). We recommend formatting the code with one statement per line. It is allowed to exclude the semicolon in the last statement of the routine.

<br><br>Comments in the code can be given by typing // on a row. The rest of this row is ignored. Example:

<p class="code">if (Status != StatusOK)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;return 10000; // Return a number higher than any valid time.<br />
else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;return ComputedTime;</p>
 
Each MRL routine calculates and returns an integer (which may be interpreted as a time in seconds, a score or number of points, or a runner status) based on input data, accessed through a fixed set of defined symbols. The return value is the last evaluated expression in the routine, but to return a specific number you can use the construction <p class="code">return &lt;value expression&gt;;</p> as in the example above.

<h3>Symbols</h3>
Each MRL routine defines a number of symbols, for example <i>Status</i>, <i>Time</i>, course <i>Course</i>, which for every run of the routine is setup with data for the competitor or team under consideration.

<br><br>A symbol can be a scalar (e.g. <i>Time</i> containing the running time for the team or runner), a vector (e.g. <i>Course</i>, which holds the course of a competitor), or a matrix (e.g. <i>RunnerCourse</i>, which holds the courses for each member of the team.).
<br><br>
Vector and matrix symbols are index from 0 using square brackets: <i>Course[2]</i> refers the the third control, <i>RunnerCourse[2][0]</i> refers to the first control for the third competitor in a team. 

<br><br>To get the size of a vector or matrix, use the syntax <i>Course.size()</i> and <i>RunnerCourse[2].size();</i> (Number of controls for the third member of the team).

Example: A status calculation, where a time between controls over 3 minutes means disqualification.

<p class="code">if (Status == StatusOK) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for (i = 0; i &lt; SplitTimes.size(); i++) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (SplitTimes[i] &gt; 60*3)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return StatusDQ; // Disqualified if split time over 3 minutes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
}<br />
return Status;<br />
</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
Variables work in a manner similar to symbols, but you define them in the code by assigning values. A variable can hold an integer or a vector of integers. In the example above <i>i</i> is a variable.
<br><br>
A vector variable can be constructed by assigning values for specific indices. 
The vector grows automatically, and is filled with zeros where no number has been assigned. If you type <tt>var[3] = 4</tt> (and <tt>var</tt> was not defined earlier), <tt>var</tt> becomes a vector with contents <tt>[0,0,0,4]</tt>. 
<br><br>
You can also create a vector variable by assigning all values at once. This will happen if you write <tt>var = &lt;name&gt;</tt> where <tt>name</tt> is the name of a vector symbol, for example <tt>RunnerCourse[0]</tt>, the course for the first member of a team (<tt>RunnerCourse</tt> is a matrix) or a vector variable.
<br><br>
You can sort a vector variable by typing <p class="code">var.sort()</p>. The following code fragment returns the code for the fastest team member:
<p class="code">times = RunnerTimes;<br />
times.sort();<br />
return times[0];<br />
</p>
<h3>Operators</h3>
MRL evaluates the most common arithmetic and logical operators. Any logic operator is evaluated to 1 of the expression is <tt>true</tt> and to 0 if the expression is <tt>false</tt>. The usual rules for operator precedence applies, use parentheses if necessary.<br><br>

<br><b>Binary Arithmetic Operators</b>
<ul><li><b>+</b>: Addition (a+b)</li><li><b>-</b>: Subtraction (a-b)</li><li><b>*</b>: Multiplication (a*b)</li><li><b>/</b>: Division (a/b)</li><li><b>%</b>: Remainder after integer division (a%b)</li><li><b>max</b>: Greatest value (max(a,b))</li><li><b>min</b>: Smallest value (min(a,b))</li></ul>

<b>Binary Logical Operators</b>
<br><br>An expression is considered true it is not 0.
<ul><li><b>==</b>: Equals (a == b)</li><li><b>!=</b>: Different from (a != b)</li><li><b>&lt;</b>: Less than (a &lt; b)</li><li><b>&gt;</b>: Greater than (a &gt; b)</li><li><b>&lt;=</b>: Less than or equal (a &lt;= b)</li><li><b>&gt;=</b>: Greater than or equal (a &gt;= b)</li><li><b>&amp;&amp;</b>: And, both true (a &amp;&amp; b)</li><li><b>||</b>: Or, at least one true (a || b)</li></ul>

<b>Unary Operators</b>
<ul><li><b>!</b>: Not (!a), true if and only if a is false</li><li><b>-</b>: Minus (-a)</li><li><b>++</b>: Increment value by 1 (++a or a++)</li><li><b>-<i></i>-</b>: Decrement value by 1 (-<i></i>-a or a-<i></i>-)</li></ul>

The operators ++ and -<i></i>- have two variants, one before and one after the variable. The difference is in how the expression itself is evaluated. If the operator comes first, the result is the expression after the increment/decrement, otherwise the result is the original value.

<p class="code">a = 0;<br />
b = ++a;<br />
c = a++;</p>
The result is that b is 1, c is also 1, and a is 2. Avoid expressions like b = ++a + a++;

<h3>Flow Control</h3>
<b>If/else statements</b>
To make different calculations depending on the evaluation of a logical expression, you can use an if/else statement. The construction is:
<p class="code">if (&lt;expression&gt;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;//Code to run if &lt;expression&gt; is true.<br />
} else {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;//Code to run if &lt;expression&gt; is false.<br />
}</p>
The else part can be left out, if this case is not needed. You can also select between several case, through the construction:
<p class="code">if (&lt;expression 1&gt;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;//Code to run if &lt;expression 1&gt; is true<br />
} else if(&lt;expression 2&gt; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;//Code to run if &lt;expression 1&gt; false and &lt;expression 2&gt; is true<br />
} ... {<br />
} else {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;//Code to run if no expression was true.<br />
}<br />
</p>
<br>
<b>For Loops</b>
A for loop is used to repeat a calculation a certain number of times. The construction is:
<p class="code">for (&lt;start&gt;; &lt;condition&gt;; &lt;update&gt;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;// Code to run.<br />
}</p>

First the statement <tt>&lt;start&gt;</tt> is executed. Then the loop code is started over and over again as long as <tt>&lt;condition&gt;</tt> is true. After the loop code has been run, the <tt>&lt;update&gt;</tt> statement is run, just before the next evaluation of <tt>&lt;condition&gt;</tt>.
<br><br>
The following example return status OK if all members of a team are OK.
<p class="code">for(i = 0; i &lt; RunnerStatus.size(); i++) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (RunnerStatus[i] != StatusOK)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return RunnerStatus[i];<br />
}<br />
return StatusOK;<br />
</p>
<br>
<b>While Loops</b>
A while loop is an alternative to a for loop, which is simpler since there is not start and update condition, The loop code is started as long as the condition is true: 
<p class="code">while (&lt;condition&gt;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;// Code to run<br />
}<br />
</p>
<br>
<b>Break</b>
A break statement is used inside a loop to abort the run, regardless of the condition of the loop. Typically, it is placed inside an if statement.

 Example, computing a score based on the number of legs in a row (from start) that you have completed under 60 seconds:
<p class="code">i=0;<br />
while (++i &lt; CardTimes.size()) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (CardTimes[i] - CardTimes[i-1] &gt; 60)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
}<br />
return i-i;<br />

<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2015-02-25</p>
To develop and test a Result Module, you need a MeOS competition already containing results of the type you want to develop the module for, that is, if you write a result module for an individual classes, you need individual results to test it with, if you write it for a team class, you need team results of that type. <div class="hint"><b>Hint</b><br>You can use the Punching Test service on the page <i style="color:#008;">Services</i> to generate a test competition.</div>

When you have written the source code for a rule, you click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Save changes</b> to compile the code. If you get an error, there is some syntax error in your code, which you need to correct. Ensure that each statement ends with a semicolon, and use the error message to locate the problem.
<br><br>

When the code is successfully saved and compiled, you can click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Test Result Module</b> to test run the code on all runners and teams with results. If everything works, you will see a table with output, status, time, points, and result score, for each runner and team. 
<br><br>
If there was an error running the method, the string <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Error</b> is shown. A typical cause is that the code tries to read a variable or symbol which is not defined, or that it uses an invalid index to access a vector symbol.
<br><br>
If you got no errors, and the output was as expected, everything is fine and you are ready to use the result module in a list. However, when running for the first time, the most likely outcome is that it does not work. Then you can select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Debug</b> on a line containing the problem. A new window opens, which shows all symbols as defined for the competitor or team, and also shows all variables that your methods define and their values. It also output runtime errors, if any.
<div class="warning"><b>Note</b><br>Be sure to test the result module carefully before using it for an important competition. Make sure that it handles incomplete teams, missing punches, failed control units, status codes other that <tt>StatusOK</tt>, etc gracefully.</div><br><br><a name="sec1989"></a><h2 class="break">Appendix I: Championships with Qualifiction and Final</h2>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-09</p>
This guide goes  through a number of steps needed to implement a championship contest (or equivalent) with qualifying and final heats. Input data is, in addition to entries and courses, ranking, which is used to create even qualifying heats and define the starting order.

<h3>Preparations</h3>
<ul><li>Create a competition and import the entries.</li><li>Import the rankings to be used for heat subdivision and seeding.</li><li>Check in the table mode for competitors that ranking has been imported as expected.</li></ul>

<h3>Heat Subdivision</h3>
<ul><li>On the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i>, select one class and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Split Class</b>.</li><li>Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Make equal classes (ranking)</b>, the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">number of classes</b> and type the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">number of competitors</b> for each heat.</li><li>When classes are created, you can rename them to your preference.</li></ul>

<h3>Drawing Start Times and Seeding</h3>
Each qualification has to be drawn manually. Usually you put up a start schedule in consultation with the competition management. 
<ul><li>Select <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw / Manage Start Times</b>. Select method <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Seeded start groups</b> and seeding source <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">ranking</b>.</li><li>Enter the desired sizes of the seeding groups (a size of one results in a strict ordering based on the ranking) and mark <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Prevent competitors from the same club to start at adjacent start times</b>, if you want to prevent that.</li><li>Enter <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">First start</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Start interval</b>. You can assign bibs now or later using the general functionality.</li></ul>
 
<h3>Run the Qualifications</h3>
No special actions need to be taken compared to an ordinary competition.

<h3>Preparing for the Final</h3>
First you need to create the final competition. 
<ul><li>Open the qualification locally and verify that MeOS functionality for several stages is activated.</li><li>Click <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Manage Several Stages</b>, and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Add New Stage</b>, and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Transfer Results to the Next Stage</b>.</li><li>Open the newly created competition and verify (the the table mode on the page <i style="color:#008;">Competitors</i>) that you have transferred competitors correctly and that everyone has the expected incoming results (place in, time in etc.) and that the heat field is defined. It is expected to be 1 for heat A, 2 for heat B etc.</li></ul>

<h3>Creating Final Classes</h3> 
<ul><li>On the page <i style="color:#008;">classes</i>, select one  of the qualification heats and click on <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Merge Classes</b> to merge it with another qualification heat. Repeat until all heats (that belong together) has become one single large class.</li><li>Select the merged class, <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Split Class</b> and <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Split by result</b>.</li><li>Enter the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Number of classes</b> and the <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Number of competitors</b> in each class.</li></ul> 

<h3>Start Times</h3>
The instruction below is for ordering the start times strictly by the results from the qualification. Of course you can use distribute start times by other rules.

<ul><li>Select again <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Draw / Manage Start Times</b> on the page <i style="color:#008;">Classes</i> and then <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Seeded start groups</b>.</li><li>Select seeding source <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Result</b>.</li><li>Enter 1 (one) as the size of the seeding groups. This means that no randomness is involved, but that each competitors comes a one person group. The qualification heat order is also used to order groups.</li><li>Select also <b style="color:#008; font-weight:600;">Prevent competitors from the same club to start at adjacent start times</b>, if you want to prevent that.</li></ul>

<div class="info"><b>MeOS Insight</b><br>MeOS does not guarantee that the start time assignment will not put competitors from the same club on adjacent times, even if you specify this. If specified, MeOS will try to move competitors to avoid collisions, but if more than half of the competitors are from the same club, this is impossible. Even if there is a high concentration of competitors from the same club in a certain part of the field, it can happen that MeOS fails to avoid a collision. Start times will be produced nevertheless.</div><br><a name="sec1977"></a><h2 class="break">Appendix II: MeOS for Mac and Linux</h2>
<p class="timestamp">Updated: 2017-03-09</p>
Currently there is only a MeOS version for Windows, which works with Windows XP and later versions.
<br><br>
On Mac it is possible to run MeOS by starting a virtual windows machine. This has been tested and seems to work well. A similar approach has also been used successfully on a Linux computer.

<h3>Linux server</h3>
Using a Linux computer as server with the MySQL database works well. Note that even fore rather large competitions, the capacity demands on the server are rather limited since every connected MeOS client perform its own computations locally. Therefore it is more important to have a robust server computer, than a fast one. In general, you can use the server computer as a client also (provided it runs a windows version) to decrease the number of computers needed.<br><br>
